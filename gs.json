          "description": "<p>This set allows Nidoking to threaten as wide an array of opponents as\npossible. STAB Earthquake running off a decent Attack stat is Nidoking's\nmain attacking move, and it does solid damage to most threats. However,\nit does run short of hitting relevant KO thresholds against certain\nwalls, such as Snorlax, Miltank, and Umbreon; Earthquake will shave off\nroughly 25-30% of these threats' HP, which is well short of a 3HKO and\njust short of even a 4HKO after Leftovers. That's where Lovely Kiss\ncomes in. With a well-timed Lovely Kiss, one of these walls can be\nindefinitely incapacitated, allowing Nidoking to go for the KO itself by\nspamming Earthquake or permitting a teammate to switch in and start\nsetting up. As for the other two moves, these are for hitting foes that\nresist or are immune to Earthquake for super effective damage. Ice Beam\nis a must to 3HKO Zapdos, as otherwise Nidoking cannot touch it even\nwith Lovely Kiss since most Zapdos run Sleep Talk. Ice Beam also allows\nNidoking to 3HKO Exeggutor and, when all else fails, to play for the\nfreeze against Miltank. The last moveslot is a bit more flexible,\nalthough Thunder is the preferred option because it guarantees a 2HKO\nagainst Starmie and Skarmory, can 3HKO Suicune and Vaporeon, and has a\n21% paralysis chance, factoring accuracy, to facilitate these KOs.\nHowever, Thunderbolt is an option if you don't want to chance a miss\nagainst a Cloyster, Skarmory, or weakened Suicune in KO range. That\nsaid, Nidoking will miss out on the KO thresholds that Thunder achieves,\nand furthermore it will do more damage to Vaporeon with Earthquake than\nit would with Thunderbolt.</p>\n<p>Nidoking is a bit easier to get to work than other heavy hitters in GSC\nbecause of its good Speed stat, access to Lovely Kiss, immunity to\nElectric moves and Toxic, and defenses that, while not great, are\npassable. However, just as with any mixed attacker, Nidoking will\nrequire a bit of prediction to be able to use appropriately. It should\nbe switching in whenever you anticipate an opponent switching to a\nPokemon that does not want to be put to sleep or that cannot afford to\ntake a super effective attack. Being able to double-switch effectively\nor, alternatively, to predict Thunders from Electric-types to prevent\nNidoking from taking damage or status on the switch will go a long way\ntoward keeping Nidoking healthy enough to still pose a threat. To\nfacilitate these double-switches, Nidoking appreciates Rapid Spin\nsupport from Starmie, Cloyster, or Forretress to keep Spikes off the\nfield. Spikes support from Cloyster and Forretress can also be helpful\nto Nidoking, especially since it struggles to KO the likes of Snorlax\nand Umbreon without such help. However, since Nidoking already has\nLovely Kiss to deal with the Pokemon it struggles to outright kill, and\nbecause one of the more common switch-ins to Nidoking is Zapdos, Spikes\ndon't help Nidoking as much as you might expect.</p>\n<p>While Nidoking is, for the most part, self-sufficient offense, there are\nPokemon that pair well with Nidoking by KOing or weakening its counters.\nSelf-Destruct Snorlax can bait and explode on these threats, in addition\nto Suicune and Miltank, to make Nidoking's life easier. Exeggutor is a\nfine partner as well, since it can bait Zapdos and Explode on it to\nallow Nidoking to aim for a better sleep target with Lovely Kiss.\nTyranitar with Rock Slide and Pursuit can help Nidoking chip away at\nZapdos to put it in Ice Beam KO range to prevent it from switching in to\nabsorb Lovely Kiss. Tyranitar also helps to weaken Exeggutor so that\nNidoking does not have to be concerned with its inability to 2HKO it.\nSteelix can bait and Explode on Miltank, Suicune, and even Zapdos to\nmake life easier for Nidoking as well.</p>\n<p>Other good partners for Nidoking are those that can capitalize off\nNidoking's ability to weaken their counters or put them to sleep.\nCurseLax generally works well with Nidoking's ability to target Charm\nUmbreon and opposing CurseLax with Lovely Kiss. Marowak and Quagsire\nappreciate Nidoking's ability to target opposing Water-types with Lovely\nKiss. Cloyster and Machamp can take advantage of Nidoking's ability to\ntarget Starmie with Lovely Kiss or Thunder paralysis. Vaporeon can\ncapitalize off Nidoking's ability to weaken Zapdos, Snorlax, and Roar\nSuicune.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Nidoking is the quintessential blue-collar Pokemon. It evolves from one\nof the earliest Pokemon you encounter in RBY, its stats aren't\nflashy--the best it gets is base 92 Attack--and its typing is a strange\nPoison / Ground mixture that you wouldn't expect to be great\ndefensively. Regardless of these reasons for humility, Nidoking has all\nthe right tools to get the job done as the premier mixed attacker of\nGSC. For starters, its movepool gives it a fairly strong STAB Earthquake\ncoupled with solid super effective coverage moves for physical walls and\nPokemon that resist it. Nidoking's immunities to Toxic and Thunder and\nits base 85 Speed, which is particularly fast by GSC standards, are also\nnice advantages that Nidoking totes over other attacking threats.\nHowever, that's not all Nidoking has to offer, for if that were the\ncase, it would still be outclassed by Pokemon with flashier stat spreads\nsuch as Tyranitar and Dragonite. Access to Lovely Kiss is Nidoking's ace\nin the hole, allowing it to instantly take one of its chief counters out\nof the game, something the other mixed sweepers can't do.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Fire Blast is an attacking option that allows Nidoking to cleanly 2HKO\nSteelix and Exeggutor while granting it an OHKO against Forretress and a\n3HKO against Heracross. However, Fire Blast must go over either Ice\nBeam, which leaves Nidoking unable to touch Zapdos, or\nThunder/Thunderbolt, which leaves Nidoking unable to do as much damage\nto Water-types, especially Suicune. Using Fire Blast over\nThunder/Thunderbolt also makes Nidoking unable to significantly damage\nCharizard, which, while uncommon, can then threaten to set up Belly Drum\nand sweep. Counter is an interesting option for surprise KOs. Morning\nSun can be used to allow Nidoking to last longer and heal off potential\nHidden Powers from Zapdos and Raikou, but it cannot be used with Lovely\nKiss. Counter even works against special Hidden Powers in GSC, so it\nallows Nidoking to bounce back Hidden Powers from Zapdos for major\ndamage, in addition to attacks from Snorlax and Miltank. However,\nCounter requires careful use to ensure the opponent is definitely in KO\nrange before it is revealed, and ultimately makes Nidoking less\neffective as a mixed attacker by taking away one of its attacking\nmoveslots.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>RestTalk Suicune, Heracross, and Snorlax are probably the most complete\nNidoking counters in existence. All three of these Pokemon can absorb\nLovely Kiss and can tank whatever attacks Nidoking can use. Suicune must\nwatch out for the 3HKO from the inaccurate Thunder, Heracross must watch\nout for the rare Fire Blast 3HKO, and Snorlax, being slower than\nNidoking and taking more from Earthquake than the other two counters,\nmust be wary of switching in, especially with Spikes down. Zapdos is\nalso a fine switch-in to Nidoking, although Ice Beam is very common,\naverages a 3HKO against Zapdos, and, unlike Thunder against Suicune, is\n100% accurate. However, unlike the other counters, Zapdos is guaranteed\nto outspeed Nidoking, is immune to Earthquake and Spikes, and can 3HKO\nNidoking with a super effective Hidden Power.</p>\n<p>When Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss, many more options for countering it\nopen up. Suicune and Snorlax without RestTalk can switch in to sponge\nhits and scare it out. Miltank is a fantastic switch-in when Sleep\nClause is active, as Nidoking is slower and cannot penetrate its\ndefenses with its attacks. Miltank can also force Nidoking to switch out\nwith the threat of Body Slam paralysis. However, if Sleep Clause is not\nactive, Miltank balks at the prospect of being put to sleep, since it is\nthen unable to cure its teammates of status with Heal Bell. Starmie is\nalso a solid check that outspeeds Nidoking, gets Recover to shrug off\nits attacks, and 2HKOes it in return. Starmie is also often common sleep\nbait to offer against Nidoking on teams without a Sleep Talk user.\nHowever, Starmie is 2HKOed by Thunder. Umbreon is slower than Nidoking,\nwhich makes switching into Earthquakes difficult at times, but otherwise\nit is a stellar wall that avoids even being 4HKOed by any of Nidoking's\nattacks. Umbreon, however, does struggle to threaten Nidoking in return;\nit can pass Mean Look to another counter that can threaten to KO\nNidoking, or it can use Charm to weaken Nidoking's Earthquake to allow\nan easier switch to another counter.</p>\n<p>Aside from the checks listed above, Sleep Talk Vaporeon also makes a\nsomewhat decent answer to Nidoking. It is slower than Nidoking, is\n4HKOed by Earthquake unlike Umbreon and Snorlax, and is even 3HKOed by\nThunder, so it is, admittedly, a very shaky check. However, it can\nabsorb Lovely Kiss with a Sleep Talk set and can threaten to 2HKO\nNidoking in return. Other slower Pokemon that can nonetheless threaten\nNidoking include Quagsire and Porygon2. Unlike Vaporeon, these Pokemon\ncannot absorb Lovely Kiss, but on the other hand, they are not 3HKOed by\nany of Nidoking's moves, either. Quagsire gets to guarantee a 2HKO in\nreturn with Earthquake, whereas Porygon2 gets access to Recover instead\nof relying on Rest to stay healthy.</p>\n<p>Other slower Pokemon that struggle to switch into or threaten Nidoking\nare Forretress and even Blissey. Forretress generally does not have a\ngood way to threaten Nidoking and fears the possible Fire Blast, but\notherwise tanks Nidoking with ease and can even attempt to stall it out\nif it runs the uncommon Rest. Obviously, it wants to switch in only\nafter Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss so that it is not rendered unable to\nlay Spikes. Blissey, on the other hand, is generally a cleric and so\nobviously wants to avoid taking a Lovely Kiss, but otherwise avoids\nbeing 2HKOed by Earthquake, which permits the use of Soft-Boiled to\nattempt to stall Nidoking. In addition, Ice Beam can threaten to 3HKO\nNidoking while Growl and even the odd Reflect (which cannot be used\nalong with Heal Bell) can make tanking Earthquakes a lot easier.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Machamp is one of GSC's deadliest attacking threats, mostly thanks to\nits 358 Attack-backed STAB Cross Chop. Cross Chop is not only an\nincredibly useful Fighting-type STAB move, which is super effective or\nat least neutral against most of GSC's big players, but it also has a\n20% critical hit rate after factoring accuracy, adding to its already\ndevastating strength. Curse is what really allows this Machamp set to\nshine, as after a Curse boost, Cross Chop is able to OHKO even the\nvaunted Skarmory with a critical hit. As a pure physical attacker, being\nable to kill Skarmory, much less in one hit, is an impressive feat\nindeed. Furthermore, even though it's a Curse sweeper, Charm Umbreon and\nGrowl Miltank can't just switch in to stall it thanks to its super\neffective Fighting-type STAB. A few teams fail to carry a Fighting\nresist; for these teams, Skarmory is often all they have to attempt to\nwall Machamp, and Skarmory will die if it gets hit by a boosted critical\nhit Cross Chop, forcing the team to crumble shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are several common Fighting-type resisting Pokemon that\ncan step in to serve as more capable Machamp walls. Even then, though,\nMachamp gets a slew of coverage moves to handle them. Rock Slide 2HKOs\nthe ever-present Zapdos after a Curse boost, whereas the choice of\nHidden Power is able to 2HKO other defensive threats. An unboosted\nHidden Power Bug 2HKOs the common Exeggutor. An unboosted Hidden Power\nGhost on the other hand is able to 2HKO the Ghost-types on average while\nstill retaining the ability to 3HKO Exeggutor. Hidden Power Bug is\nusually preferred because Exeggutor directly forces Machamp to switch\nout with its STAB Psychic whereas Ghost-types still take a lot of damage\nfrom Curse-boosted Rock Slides and can't threaten direct damage to\nMachamp to force it out easily. Regardless of which Hidden Power is\nchosen, they both also give Machamp some recourse against its number one\ncheck: Starmie. Starmie without Reflect are 2HKOed by Hidden Power after\na Curse boost, and Reflect variants are 2HKOed after three Curse boosts,\nwhich are easily obtainable without taking too much damage from Surf if\nMachamp Curses on the turns that Starmie switches in and uses Reflect.\nThanks to the combination of Curse and Hidden Power, in addition to the\nfact that Starmie's Surf only 4HKOes Machamp, Starmie needs to run\nPsychic to consistently scare Machamp into switching out with the threat\nof the 2HKO, and even then Machamp can still kill a weakened Starmie\n(62-73% health) with a Curse-boosted Hidden Power while being able to\ntank a single STAB Psychic with plenty of health to spare. Even\nconsidering all of this, though, Machamp could simply rely on its team\nto clear out Starmie for it and instead use Fire Blast in the last slot,\nwhich handily 3HKOes Exeggutor and allows Machamp to easily KO Skarmory\nwithout burning through precious Cross Chop PP attempting to score the\ncritical hit.</p>\n<p>Machamp's ability to tank hits, especially STAB Water-type attacks,\nconstitutes one of its main selling points over the similar Swords Dance\nMarowak (the other being the raw wallbreaking potential of a boosted\ncritical hit Cross Chop). However, while Machamp has an easier time\nsetting up because of its ability to take hits, it shouldn't be\nswitching into attacks very often, as if it does, its lack of\nresistances or a recovery move means that it will simply be worn down\nwithout being able to use that extra bulk to set up. Because of this, it\nneeds to be played similarly to Marowak in that it needs to be switched\nin judiciously on predicted non-attacking turns on the opponent's part,\npreferably on predicted switches to Snorlax to nab a free turn to set up\nCurses or predict switches to Exeggutor as the opponent will undoubtedly\nswitch out to avoid taking the possible STAB Cross Chop. However, while\nMachamp isn't immediately forced out by anything with an attacking move\nand a modicum of Defense the way Marowak is, it does rely on a much less\naccurate, less reliable, and more PP-starved STAB move than Marowak\ndoes. Indeed, as often as Cross Chop can win games by breaking key walls\nwith timely critical hits, it can also disappoint with untimely misses,\nforcing Machamp to become worn down without accomplishing anything on\nthe offensive, even if played perfectly.</p>\n<p>Curse sweeping Machamp, much like Swords Dance Marowak, loves plenty of\nsupport to help it get in position to break walls. Paralysis is first\nand foremost the biggest assistance to this Machamp. A paralyzed\nSkarmory is unable to use Curse after switching in on Machamp's Curse,\nrendering it unable to stall out Machamp's Cross Chop PP as it attempts\nto score a critical hit. Furthermore, paralyzed Umbreon cannot switch in\non a turn that Machamp uses Curse to neutralize Machamp by setting its\nAttack stage to -1; Machamp can't afford to waste Cross Chops on turns\nwhen its Attack stage is so low, as even against Umbreon, which takes\nsuper effective damage, a -1 Cross Chop fails to 2HKO without a critical\nhit. In general, paralysis is great even against the foes Machamp is\nsupposed to set up against and beat; it prevents Machamp from being worn\ndown every turn that it chooses to attack, and can transform the\npossible Cross Chop miss from a potential sweep-ender to a minor\ninconvenience. Some of the better paralysis-spreading partners for\nMachamp include Stun Spore Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, Thunder Wave\nZapdos, and Body Slam Snorlax.</p>\n<p>Other support that is appreciated by Machamp includes Pokemon that can\nbait its counters to switch into Explosions. Cloyster is probably the\nbest at this, as it can bait Starmie in to spin away its Spikes, only to\nsubsequently Explode on it and free up Machamp to rampage. Exeggutor and\nSteelix often end up catching foes such as Zapdos and Suicune that can\notherwise wear Machamp down with their STAB special attacks. Machamp\nusually beats these foes if it Curses on the turn that they switch in,\nbut it takes a lot of damage in the process, so being rid of the likes\nof Zapdos and Suicune beforehand is a great help to Machamp's sweeping\nefforts. Further support includes Pursuit users. Tyranitar, Umbreon, and\nHoundoom are all adept at catching Exeggutor, which otherwise causes\nMachamp problems by forcing it out with STAB Psychic. They are also all\ngood at forcing Ghost-types to take residual damage to put them in +1\nRock Slide 2HKO range if Machamp opts for Hidden Power Bug over Hidden\nPower Ghost. Furthermore, Tyranitar can severely weaken Zapdos with\nPursuits on the switch out, whereas Umbreon can use the combination of\nToxic and Pursuit to force Starmie into +1 Hidden Power OHKO range\nbefore it can switch in to combat Machamp. Finally, Rapid Spin support\nfrom Starmie can be a great help to give Machamp more leeway to predict\nopportunities to switch in. However, it's not absolutely necessary for\nMachamp, as it can often restore the health lost to Spikes with\nLeftovers as it stays in to set up, whereas other heavy-hitters such as\nMarowak and Rhydon need Rapid Spin support much more because they are\nusually limited to using one attack before being forced to switch out.</p>\n<p>While this Machamp is well-tailored to take on its most common checks,\nthere are still a few things it will struggle mightily to get past.\nNidoking resists everything it has except for the weak Hidden Power\nGhost, although its offensive nature means that it lacks a recovery move\nitself, and its moderate attacking stats mean that it won't be able to\ndo much damage to Machamp in return, thereby allowing Machamp to set up\nfairly safely against Nidoking unless it has yet to use Lovely Kiss.\nHeracross poses a bigger problem to Machamp; it resists Cross Chop and\ncan either Curse up alongside Machamp or wear it down with Seismic Toss.\nA +2 Rock Slide will 3HKO an unboosted Heracross, though, as will an\nunboosted Fire Blast should Machamp be using it, so Seismic Toss will\nnot KO Machamp in time if it Curses on the switch unless Heracross gets\nlucky and consistently hits Rest and Seismic Toss with Sleep Talk at\ncritical moments. Muk is probably the toughest thing for Machamp to deal\nwith, as it resists Cross Chop, Curses up alongside Machamp, and can\ndish out heavy damage in return with Sludge Bomb. However, Muk is\nusually on a suicide mission and often uses Explosion to take itself out\nof commission, thereby effectively dealing with itself to allow Machamp\nan opportunity to sweep. These threats are far less common and effective\nas Machamp checks than the likes of Zapdos and Exeggutor, and as a\nresult, using moves such as Earthquake and Fire Blast to deal with these\nthreats is rare and generally not worth the trouble.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This Machamp gives up the ability to set up with Curse in return for\nmore coverage. While being able to set up Curse is helpful for beating\nthe likes of Suicune and weakened Starmie, in most cases Machamp doesn't\neven need to set up to threaten major damage against most threats, and\nthe extra moveslot gives Machamp another coverage move to help it beat\nwhat it normally couldn't. Cross Chop is the obvious STAB move, running\noff of Machamp's ludicrous Attack stat, having a high critical hit rate\nfor breaking walls, and having a great STAB typing for hitting half of\nmost teams for super effective damage. However, not having Curse to\nboost its power means that Machamp must waste a lot of Cross Chop's PP\nlooking for the critical hit if it's beating Suicune or Skarmory with\nit. Rock Slide is another non-negotiable moveslot, as it guarantees a\n3HKO on Zapdos, something that otherwise walls Machamp entirely. The\nother two moveslots ultimately depend on what threats you want Machamp\nto be able to handle. Earthquake is an excellent move that isn't usually\nconsidered a good coverage move alongside Fighting STAB. However, it\ndoes hit Poison- and Ghost-type switch-ins hard, and it's a 100%\naccurate 100 Base Power move that helps to preserve Cross Chop's PP\nagainst Ground-weak foes and that ensures low-health foes can be\nfinished off. Body Slam could also be used to paralyze Starmie\nswitch-ins, which otherwise walls Machamp completely and is very adept\nat avoiding paralysis. The last moveslot depends further on what Machamp\nwants to be able to hurt. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move, as\nit preserves Cross Chops against Steel-types (most notably Skarmory),\nand can also be used to handily 3HKO Exeggutor and to 3HKO Heracross on\naverage. Using one of the Hidden Powers in this slot is also an option;\nHidden Power Bug 2HKOs Exeggutor switch-ins, whereas Hidden Power Ghost\ncan 2HKO Ghost-types if Earthquake is foregone for Body Slam. If Body\nSlam is used as the third move, using Hidden Power in the last slot\nallows Machamp to both paralyze and KO Starmie on its own, which other\nsets cannot accomplish.</p>\n<p>As always, Cross Chop can be very annoying with its unreliable accuracy\nand meager 8 PP. However, Machamp sporting Earthquake and Fire Blast can\npreserve its Cross Chop PP in many situations, including against\nSteel-types and Raikou, and Earthquake also allows Machamp to finish off\nlow-health foes with a reliable 100% accurate move that, unlike Hidden\nPower, is actually strong enough to ensure reasonable KOs. As a result,\nall-out attacking Machamp isn't as dependent on the use of Cross Chop as\nother Machamp variants are, although it is still just as likely to miss\nagainst Snorlax in a critical moment to lead to Machamp being KOed by\nDouble-Edge as it is to score the timely critical hit to KO Suicune.\nAlso, like the Curse sweeper, this Machamp needs to be played cautiously\nto ensure it doesn't take too much damage on the switch in. All-out\nattacking Machamp is more of a hit-and-run type of Pokemon than it is a\nset-up-and-sweep Pokemon, so it isn't as desperate to be at full health\nto ensure it can set up. Regardless, it's still slow and doesn't have\nany resistances to common attacks, so it can be quite an easy task to\nwear down Machamp before it can break anything if one isn't judicious\nabout when Machamp is switched in. This means no switching Machamp\ndirectly into Snorlax's STAB moves, but rather switching Machamp into\npredicted Snorlax switch-ins.</p>\n<p>This Machamp, while less impactful on offense, is more self-sufficient\nand therefore doesn't require as much support to ensure some kind of\nsetup. Its goal is simply to come in, hit something, switch out, then\nrepeat until the opponent's team is dented enough to go for the kill.\nStill, Machamp's low Speed means that paralysis support from Stun Spore\nExeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, and Body Slam Snorlax is still\nextremely appreciated so that Machamp, upon switching in, might be able\nto force walls such as Zapdos and Suicune to take two hits upon\nswitching in, thereby vastly improving Machamp's ability to KO these\nwalls or to force the opponent to either predict around Machamp or\nsacrifice a Pokemon to get their wall in safely. Paralysis support also\nallows Machamp to outspeed Umbreon to prevent it from switching in on a\npredicted non-Cross Chop turn and subsequently neutralizing Machamp with\nCharm. In addition, using Explosions to take out Machamp's walls is\nprobably more important for this set than it is for the Curse sweeper,\nas this Machamp can't just use Curse to muscle its way past threats that\nresist its attacks. In particular, using Cloyster or even Steelix to\nExplode on Starmie is key to allowing Machamp to do relevant damage to\nother Pokemon, especially if it forgoes Body Slam for broader coverage\nagainst other threats. Steelix and Exeggutor can help Machamp out by\ntargeting Suicune and Zapdos with Explosion, as they otherwise make life\ndifficult for all-out attacking Machamp. Pursuit support from Tyranitar,\nUmbreon, and Houndoom also helps Machamp immensely against Exeggutor,\nand Tyranitar has the added bonus of being able to chip away at Zapdos.\nUmbreon is a poor partner for the all-out attacking Machamp set, as it\ndoesn't do enough to Starmie with Pursuit on the switch out to ensure it\nwill be KOed by an unboosted Hidden Power as it switches back into\nMachamp, not to mention that all-out attacking Machamp might not even be\ncarrying Hidden Power. This set also appreciates Rapid Spin support a\nlot more than Curse Machamp does, as this Machamp is more of a\nhit-and-run Pokemon and is therefore not likely to get a lot of\nLeftovers recovery to restore health lost to Spikes. Having its own\nSpikes to aid in getting kills is also more appreciated by all-out\nattacking Machamp, as it's a much more opportunistic killer than the\nMachamp that sets up with Curse, and Spikes makes it much more likely\nthat walls switching into all-out attacking Machamp are either put into\nKO range, or are limited to the Spikes-immune Zapdos and Skarmory to\nease prediction.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Machamp has pretty decent defensive stats to accompany its mammoth\nAttack and Fighting STAB; this set aims to take advantage of this bulk\nby using it for longevity and allowing Machamp to act as a mixed wall,\nrather than simply using it to allow Machamp the leeway to switch in and\nset up a sweep. This Machamp, thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk, is an\nexcellent Snorlax check, being able to Rest off Double-Edges on the\nswitch, force Snorlax to switch out with the threat of Cross Chop, and\nbe constantly available thanks to Sleep Talk. Sleep Talk also allows\nMachamp to get around one of its biggest downfalls by conserving Cross\nChop PP via PP-free uses of the move with Sleep Talk turns. Curse rounds\nout the set by allowing Machamp to match Snorlax's Curses and to allow\nit to Curse up and sweep when Fighting-resisting Pokemon have been\ncleared out of the way. This Machamp set does not have the coverage\noptions that other sets have, and as such, having Cross Chop as its only\nattacking move means that it will be unable to touch Ghost-types and\nwill either be beaten or outstalled by Fighting-type resisting Psychic-\nand Flying-types as well. Still, once these Pokemon are defeated, this\nMachamp set absolutely ravages opposing teams and cannot be killed very\neasily in return.</p>\n<p>RestTalk Machamp is not a purely offensive being; in fact, it's more\ndefensive than offensive by virtue of the many things that wall it. It's\nbulky enough to avoid being 3HKOed by the big 3 mixed attackers:\nTyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite without Hidden Power Flying (which is\nmost Dragonite). Furthermore, it scares them out with the threat of a\nCurse-based setup, and manages to, unlike other mixed walls, force\nSnorlax to switch out by virtue of STAB Cross Chop (and beats\nlast-Pokemon CurseLax to boot). While this set struggles to get past any\nFighting-type resisting Pokemon (and is therefore less offensive than\nother variants), this Machamp can brutalize those few teams that fail to\nuse a Fighting resist because it not only has the ability to set up with\nCurse and KO walls such as Skarmory with a critical hit Cross Chop, but\nalso the ability to stick around with Rest and Sleep Talk unlike\nsweeping Machamp sets. Still, though it has incredible offensive setup\npotential by virtue of its longevity, this Machamp's main selling point\nis its aforementioned defensive virtues, as a single Ghost-type will\nrender it useless, and any Fighting-type resist should be able to beat\nit fairly easily.</p>\n<p>While Sleep Talk does help Cross Chop's PP problems to an extent, it\nstill only has a paltry 8 PP, making it fairly easy to stall out, and it\nalso still has a very unreliable 80% accuracy. Because of this, Machamp\nusually needs to use a couple of Curses before it begins firing off\nCross Chops so that it has enough power to minimize its Cross Chop PP\nconsumption and also to minimize the impact of misses by being able to\nKO most Pokemon in a single hit. However, Machamp can't start Cursing\nwhile Fighting-immune Ghosts or Fighting-resisting special attackers\nsuch as Exeggutor or Zapdos are on the field; these foes will either\nthreaten Machamp into switching out or stall Machamp out of Cross Chops.\nBecause of this, this Machamp set appreciates Pursuit support much more\nthan other sets that have coverage moves specifically for beating these\nthreats. Tyranitar, as always, is an excellent partner, being able to\nPursuit trap Ghosts and Exeggutor while also being able to chip away at\nZapdos. Houndoom also traps Exeggutor and Ghost-types with Pursuit, and\nUmbreon shines against Exeggutor but can struggle to Pursuit trap\nGhost-types because it fails to KO them with Pursuit before Perish trap\nmanages to kill it. Using Explosion with Cloyster, Exeggutor, and\nSteelix to bait and kill the likes of Starmie and Zapdos is also solid\nsupport to wipe out Machamp's checks and clear its way for a sweep.\nHaving paralysis support from the likes of Stun Spore Exeggutor and Body\nSlam Snorlax is, as with all Machamp sets, very valuable, as Skarmory\ncan safely switch in and match Machamp's Curses otherwise, and Umbreon\ncan switch in on a predicted Curse and Charm Machamp's Attack down to\neffectively waste any Cross Chops to follow. Additionally, Rapid Spin\nsupport is very handy for this Machamp, as it is very slow and lacks\ngood resistances. It normally walls the big 3 mixed attackers because it\nfails to be 3HKOed by any of them, but it is outsped by all of them and\nthere is no guarantee that it will be able to take Spikes damage on top\nof two Nidoking Earthquakes or Dragonite Double-Edges as it switches in.\nHaving Spikes cleared means that Machamp is also guaranteed to avoid\nbeing 2HKOed by Snorlax's Double-Edge if it manages to mispredict and\nswitch into it, thereby giving Machamp the leeway to switch in and deter\nSnorlax from setting up.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>With Snorlax being the king of GSC, Machamp seems like a pretty good\nidea given its mighty Fighting STAB. However, it takes as much as 49%\nswitching into Snorlax's Double-Edge, making it a shaky check for the\nbig lug. However, while Machamp is a shaky Snorlax check, on offense\nit's a monster -- half of the Pokemon on most teams are weak to\nFighting-type attacks, severely limiting what can switch into Machamp.\nFurthermore, a few teams do not even have a Fighting resist, allowing\nMachamp to steamroll these teams when it comes across them if it manages\nto OHKO Skarmory with a +1 critical hit Cross Chop. Cross Chop has a 20%\ncritical hit rate after factoring accuracy, so going for the critical\nhit is a viable strategy and not just a pipe dream. Machamp also has\ndecent 90 / 80 / 85 defenses, allowing an all-out attacker much more\nleeway to switch in than the similar Marowak, and permitting the use of\na more defensive RestTalk set to tank mixed sweepers. Machamp does have\nits flaws, though. Its low Speed, Spikes vulnerability, lack of useful\nresistances, and good-but-not-great defenses make it extremely\nvulnerable to simply being beat down upon, and it's also often the\nvictim of bad luck and PP issues thanks to Cross Chop's 80% accuracy,\nmeager 8 PP, and dependence on the critical hit to break walls such as\nSkarmory.</p>\n",

      }, 
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Using Earthquake or Body Slam over one of the coverage options on the\nCurse sweeper set is a possibility, but generally an inferior\npossibility because it deprives Machamp of crucial coverage against\neither the ultra-common Zapdos or Exeggutor. In addition, the Curse\nsweeper could also ditch one of the coverage moves in favor of Rest to\npermit it to setup, break a wall, then Rest off damage and status for\nlater carnage, but this is not recommended without Heal Bell support as\nMachamp is dead weight while asleep. Counter, too, is a good option for\nMachamp, but honestly it's only really viable on the all-out attacker\nset as, again, the Curse sweeper relies on its specific coverage moves\nto get past common threats. Counter allows Machamp to KO Skarmory or\neven Zapdos going for the Drill Peck, and also punishes foes such as\nNidoking and Heracross trying to wear Machamp down with Earthquake and\nSeismic Toss, respectively. However, while Counter can catch these foes\noff guard, Machamp's vast attacking movepool, excellent Fighting STAB,\nand huge 358 Attack stat mean that it's usually better off using an\nattacking move to maximize coverage rather than waiting to catch\nsomething off guard with Counter. Meditate is an interesting option over\nCurse on the Curse sweeper set to allow Machamp the opportunity to boost\nits Attack without lowering its Speed. Generally, the extra Defense from\nCurse is preferred to allow Machamp to tank Drill Pecks from Skarmory\nand Double-Edges from Snorlax as it attacks, but not suffering a Speed\ndrop can be useful if Machamp is being passed Agility boosts or for\npreserving the Speed tie against Exeggutor and allowing Machamp to OHKO\nwith a +1 Hidden Power Bug with a 50% chance of not having to take a\nPsychic in return. Hidden Power Rock can be used over Rock Slide if\nMachamp isn't using an anti-Psychic Hidden Power. Hidden Power's perfect\naccuracy can be preferred over Rock Slide's 90% accuracy, whereas Rock\nSlide is not likely to be flinching anything relevant. A particularly\ninteresting, but generally not very effective, gimmick would be the use\nof Berserk Gene over Leftovers on the all-out attacking set. The +2\nAttack boost without setup can sometimes catch opponents off guard, and\nif Machamp gets lucky and consistently hits past confusion it can\nquickly take one or two Pokemon down with it before it succumbs to\nconfusion damage and damage sustained from attacks by faster foes.\nHowever, Berserk Gene gives Machamp one shot at making a difference, as\nonce Machamp is switched out, Berserk Gene is consumed, leaving Machamp\na regular all-out attacker but with much less longevity thanks to the\nlack of Leftovers. Furthermore, the 50% likelihood during any given turn\nof simply having Machamp smack itself for non-trivial damage makes\nBerserk Gene a very high-risk item that generally isn't worth it. Along\nthe lines of gimmicks that generally aren't worth it, Vital Throw and\nLight Screen fall into this category. Vital Throw is often prized for\nits -1 priority, thereby preventing Machamp from being phazed after a\nCurse. The problem is that Vital Throw is so very weak compared to Cross\nChop's raw power, and the phaze immunity hardly matters to Machamp as\nmost phazers aren't able to safely phaze with the threat of a +1 Cross\nChop looming over them. In addition, Vital Throw's negative priority can\nscrew Machamp over if it needs to outspeed Snorlax (e.g., after a Belly\nDrum) and KO it with its STAB Fighting move. Light Screen, on the other\nhand, is often seen as a good move as the biggest threats to a Machamp\nsweep are STAB Psychic users and accumulated damage from STAB Surfs and\nThunders. However, giving up a coverage move on Machamp itself is not a\ngood way to set up Light Screen for Machamp, as it reduces the impact of\nMachamp once it does get a Light Screen boost. Rather, Light Screen is\nbest used by a teammate, such as Blissey or Zapdos, to permit Machamp\nthe best use of its attacking movepool while still enabling it to tank\nPsychics and other powerful special moves when a teammate pseudo-passes\nLight Screen to it.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Starmie is widely considered the most dependable check to Machamp, and\nfor good reason. It resists Cross Chop, avoids being 2HKOed by an\nunboosted Hidden Power, and can 2HKO back with Psychic. Of course,\nwithout Psychic, Starmie risks having RestTalk Machamp set up on it, as\nSurf is only a 4HKO, and also risks being KOed by any Machamp with Curse\nand Hidden Power; after a single Curse, Machamp 2HKOs Starmie without a\ndefense boost, and after 3 Curses, which Machamp can easily set up in\nthe face of Starmie's Surf, Machamp can 2HKO even Starmie behind a\nReflect. Exeggutor is also a prime Machamp check, being able to switch\nin easily on a Cross Chop or Curse and 2HKO with Psychic. However,\nExeggutor must be wary of Hidden Power Bug, which 2HKOes without a Curse\nboost and OHKOes after Machamp uses Curse. Zapdos is another Pokemon\nthat acts as a soft check to Machamp; it 3HKOes with Thunder or\nThunderbolt and resists Cross Chop, although most Machamp carry Rock\nSlide specifically for Zapdos and will be able to 2HKO after a Curse\nboost. Suicune can repeatedly smack Machamp with Surf for the 4HKO; this\nisn't enough to guarantee Machamp is killed before it is able to kill\nSuicune in return though, because Suicune is 3HKOed by non-critical hit\nCross Chop, it will usually be enough to weaken Machamp to where it\nwon't be able to accomplish anything else after killing Suicune, and\nmight be enough to flat out beat Machamp if Cross Chop misses. All-out\nattacking Machamp is walled much harder by Suicune, as it fails to be\n3HKOed by an unboosted Cross Chop, whereas RestTalk Machamp will\noutright beat any Suicune without Roar due to its ability to use Rest to\nrestore health lost to Surf. Skarmory is another check that works well\nagainst non-Fire Blast Machamp; it can use Curse to match Machamp's\nboosts and threaten to 3HKO in return with STAB Drill Peck. Critical hit\nCross Chops or the uncommon Fire Blast can beat it, though. The\nobservant should notice a pattern with these checks: Machamp has some\nway of beating them all. Still, all of these checks can go up against\nMachamp well enough to ensure, at the very least, Machamp is too\ncrippled to do more than break that one check, and at best, they abuse\nMachamp's propensity to beat itself with Cross Chop's low accuracy and\nPP.</p>\n<p>Machamp also has a few other checks that are more situational and less\ncommon than those listed above. Most Machamp do not use Earthquake\nbecause it's generally a poor coverage move to run alongside Cross Chop,\nwhich is excellent news for Muk as a Machamp counter. Without\nEarthquake, Machamp really has no way of getting past Muk, as Muk can\nmatch Machamp's attempts to Curse up and beat it while being able to\ndeal heavy damage to Machamp with STAB Sludge Bomb. Heracross makes a\nsolid check to Machamp as well. It resists Cross Chop, Machamp rarely\nhas a coverage move specifically for dealing heavy damage to Heracross,\nand Heracross can slowly but surely 5HKO Machamp with Seismic Toss, or\nuse Curse to match Machamp's boosts. Curse Heracross, unlike Seismic\nToss variants, can also wall Sleep Talk Machamp and out-PP it thanks to\nCross Chop's meager 8 PP. Fire Blast Machamp threatens to 3HKO\nHeracross, though, but Fire Blast, much like Cross Chop, is fairly easy\nto stall out of PP. Nidoking and Tentacruel can also check\nnon-Earthquake Machamp to an extent by virtue of their Poison typing,\nthe former being able to use Lovely Kiss to incapacitate Machamp and the\nlatter being able to outpace Curse's defense boosts with Swords Dance.\nMachamp ultimately beats both of these threats with enough Curse boosts\nin spite of their ability to resist Cross Chop, rendering RestTalk\nMachamp thoroughly uncheckable by these particular Poison-types.\nHowever, while RestTalk Machamp gets credit for matching up well against\nHeracross and non-Cursing Poison-types, the fact that it can only attack\nusing Cross Chop renders it incapable of touching Ghost-types entirely.\nMachamp can't afford to PP stall Gengar, as Cross Chop has terrible PP,\nand Gengar can always play for the freeze with Ice Punch or kill Machamp\nwith a timely critical hit Thunderbolt. Misdreavus, on the other hand,\nimmediately forces Machamp to switch out. In addition to hardwalling\nRestTalk Machamp, Ghosts are also good checks to Machamp variants\nlacking Earthquake or Hidden Power Ghost, as Machamp can only 3HKO with\nRock Slide after a Curse boost, whereas Gengar can severely wear Machamp\ndown with Thunderbolts and a full-health Misdreavus needs to be 2HKOed\nto guarantee that it fails to kill Machamp with Perish Trap. Meganium\nmakes another uncommon but effective Machamp check. Behind Reflect, with\nLeech Seed sapping Machamp's health, and with Synthesis to provide\ninstant healing, Meganium acts to thoroughly outstall Machamp. Slowbro\nrounds out the list of uncommon checks, but it certainly is a good one;\nit can use Growl or Reflect to neutralize Curse variants, or threaten to\noutright kill Machamp with Psychic. Its reliance on Rest for recovery\ncoupled with its Hidden Power weakness can render it beatable by\nMachamp, though.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Psychic is Exeggutor's main attacking move that allows it to punish\nopponents that try to over-predict against Exeggutor, since the\ndual-threat of Explosion and Sleep Powder can force a lot of switches.\nRunning off 348 Special Attack, Exeggutor can do heavy damage to Pokemon\nthat are not named Snorlax or resistant to it. Unfortunately, Psychic is\nresisted by quite a lot of Pokemon, including Skarmory and Tyranitar,\nthe latter being immune to it. Furthermore, these foes also resist\nExeggutor's Explosion, and to top it off Exeggutor cannot cover both of\nthese threats with just one coverage move. Giga Drain is typically\nchosen to deal with Tyranitar since it is immune to Psychic and can\nPursuit Exeggutor to death, although Hidden Power Fire can be used to\ndeal heavy damage to Skarmory and Forretress instead. Giga Drain is\nchosen over Hidden Power Grass for dealing with Tyranitar because,\nalthough Hidden Power Grass is stronger, both moves 3HKO Tyranitar while\nGiga Drain heals Exeggutor to avoid the guaranteed 2HKO at the hands of\nCrunch or Fire Blast. However, thanks to Sleep Powder, even though\nExeggutor can't have enough attacks to damage everything it wants to, it\ncan still threaten to incapacitate what it can't outright attack.\nExeggutor can also use Stun Spore to spread status more readily without\nhaving to worry about Sleep Clause. This works best if your team already\nhas another Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move. Finally, with Explosion,\nExeggutor can take out a special wall such as Snorlax, or a RestTalk\nuser--such as Zapdos or Raikou--that can avoid being 3HKOed by Psychic\nand absorb sleep to boot.</p>\n<p>Because of Exeggutor's ability to instantly take something out of the\ngame, it's usually best to pair it with Pokemon that appreciate having\nspecific targets removed for them. The threat of Exeggutor's Sleep\nPowder tends to draw Sleep Talk using Electric-types into the fray,\nwhich Exeggutor can take advantage of and Explode on them, so pairing\nExeggutor with Vaporeon can allow for a potential Growth sweep\nundeterred by Zapdos or Raikou. Exeggutor tends to bait Umbreon\nswitch-ins and put them to sleep or Explode on them, so Pokemon such as\nCurse Snorlax and Mixed Tyranitar, who otherwise struggle to get past\nCharm Umbreon, can be paired effectively with Exeggutor. Giga Drain\nExeggutor can put Skarmory to sleep, so it can allow Belly Drum Snorlax\nto set up a sweep while its main counter snoozes. Hidden Power Fire\nExeggutor tends to put Tyranitar to sleep, so pairing this set with\nsomething else that struggles with Tyranitar, such as Gengar, would\nallow you to get past it. In addition, if Exeggutor uses Stun Spore over\nSleep Powder, Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Belly Drum Snorlax have a\ngood chance of beating Zapdos and Skarmory, respectively, if they are\nparalyzed.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, Exeggutor tends to synergize very well with many\nteams. Several difficult-to-counter threats, such as Marowak, Machamp,\nand Vaporeon, are all checked thanks to Exeggutor's typing. Giga Drain\nExeggutor in particular is good defensively, as it can 3HKO Vaporeon\nwith the STAB Grass move, can fight back against Tyranitar Pursuit\nattempts, can keep its health up with the healing Giga Drain provides,\nand doesn't suffer the significant HP reduction that the Hidden Power\nFire variant does. However, Exeggutor must watch out to avoid taking an\nunexpected Hidden Power Bug or Fire Blast from Marowak and Machamp on\nthe switch, or an Ice Beam from Vaporeon. Exeggutor therefore works best\nas a secondary check to these threats rather than as a team's main\ndefensive switch-in to them.</p>\n<p>Exeggutor must be very wary of status. If Exeggutor ends up taking a\nToxic, it simply gets worn down as it switches in, which forces it to\nrush into using Sleep Powder or Explosion. Paralysis, on the other hand,\ncan prevent Exeggutor from Exploding or putting a foe to sleep after\ntaking a big hit, or can prevent Exeggutor from checking foes it should\nbe able to outspeed and threaten, such as Marowak, post-Curse Machamp,\nand Snorlax. Because of this, it is a good idea to pair Exeggutor with\nsomething to absorb status, such as RestTalk Zapdos or Raikou. Both are\nalso great at forcing Skarmory to switch out, and appreciate Exeggutor's\nability to put Tyranitar to sleep. Raikou in particular also defends\nagainst opposing RestTalk Electric-types that are bound to switch into\nExeggutor. In this same vein, Heal Bell and Rapid Spin support might\nalso seem like good ideas to heal Exeggutor of status and to prevent\nExeggutor from being worn down by Spikes damage, respectively. However,\nExeggutor tends to find itself on relatively fast-paced teams, and using\nthese support options tend to slow a team down, so think of these more\nas conveniences rather than necessary support for Exeggutor.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is a bit of a mixed bag. Defensively, it has resistances to\nGround-, Electric-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks that allow it to\ncheck a wide variety of threats, including Marowak, Vaporeon, and\nMachamp. However, its low Special Defense and weaknesses to Ice-, Fire-,\nDark-, and Bug-type attacks leave Exeggutor vulnerable to being\nPursuit-trapped or being hit hard by a surprise Hidden Power Bug, Ice\nBeam, or Fire Blast from one of the threats it is supposed to check. On\nthe offense side of things, it gets access to Sleep Powder, Explosion,\nStun Spore, and Leech Seed in addition to a high Special Attack stat off\nof which to run a strong STAB Psychic. However, it usually needs to\nchoose between using either Giga Drain or Hidden Power Fire for\ncoverage, which tends to leave it stuck against either Skarmory or\nTyranitar, both of which resist Exeggutor's other attacks, including\nExplosion. While it has its limitations, Exeggutor can be a nightmare to\ndeal with if one is not well-prepared for it, and it usually ends up\ntaking at least one opposing Pokemon out of the game.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Exeggutor has plenty of other tricks up its sleeve. You could use both\nSleep Powder and Stun Spore for a double powder set, although this\nleaves Exeggutor without a coverage move for either Tyranitar or\nSkarmory. In addition, Leech Seed is an interesting option for forcing\neven more switches, as the residual damage and healing can turn\notherwise poor match-ups for Exeggutor into winning ones. Leech Seed is\noften used with Stun Spore and Substitute on a SubSeed set, and it is\neffective at forcing switches and spreading status throughout the team.\nSubSeed is especially effective if Spikes are down to punish the\ninevitable switching the opponent is bound to do. Exeggutor could also\nditch the status move on the standard set and instead run an all-out\nattacking set with Psychic, Giga Drain, Hidden Power Fire, and\nExplosion. The power of this set is that it ensures that Exeggutor will\nbe able to damage Normal-resistors enough to pull off a relevant\nExplosion. The downside, of course, is that Exeggutor tends to thrive\noff its ability to threaten status and punish the switches that result\nfrom this threat. Synthesis and Moonlight are options to give Exeggutor\na reliable recovery option, but Exeggutor is less a tank and more an\ninstant offensive threat, so giving up an offensive move for healing is\nnot recommended. Exeggutor also gets access to Reflect, which can assist\na Leech Seed set in tanking Snorlax, but in general Exeggutor wants to\nbe attacking and inflicting status, not setting up screens.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Sleep Talk Zapdos and Raikou are the most common counters to Exeggutor,\nas they absorb sleep and can threaten Exeggutor out with Hidden Power\nIce. In addition, other Sleep Talk users such as Snorlax, Suicune, and\nVaporeon can all absorb sleep and take Exeggutor's attacks well,\nalthough the Sleep Talk using Water-types should be wary of Giga Drain's\npotential 3HKO, even if Exeggutor can be easily stalled out of Giga\nDrain's meager 8 PP. Sleep Talk Vaporeon is a particularly shaky\nswitch-in because it needs to set up multiple Growths before it can\nforce Exeggutor out, although if you predict a Sleep Powder, Vaporeon\ncan take it with the best of them. Note that Exeggutor also has the\npower to Explode on all of these threats, so even though they can absorb\nsleep and take its hits, Exeggutor is looking precisely for these\nmatch-ups so it can Explode to take these Pokemon down.</p>\n<p>Skarmory and Forretress are incapacitated by sleep, but otherwise resist\nExplosion, threaten Exeggutor with their STABs, and resist both Psychic\nand Giga Drain. However, Hidden Power Fire variants can spell trouble\nfor them, especially in the case of Forretress. Tyranitar, on the other\nhand, is also vulnerable to sleep, but is immune to Psychic, resists\nExplosion, and can threaten Exeggutor with Fire Blast and Crunch while\nnailing it with Pursuit if it switches out. However, Exeggutor can\nthreaten with Giga Drain, which not only 3HKOes Tyranitar but also heals\nExeggutor enough to prevent even Fire Blast and Crunch from guaranteeing\na 2HKO, so Tyranitar generally cannot just switch into Exeggutor and\nspam Pursuit to defeat it. Some more complete counters include Umbreon\nand Houndoom. These Pokemon can take Psychic, Giga Drain, and Hidden\nPower Fire. Umbreon can outspeed and use Charm to render Exeggutor's\nExplosion useless, use Toxic to cripple it, and use Pursuit to do 43-50%\nto it if it switches out. Houndoom, on the other hand, simply outspeeds\nand is likely to OHKO with Fire Blast or do 62-73% with Pursuit if\nExeggutor switches out. However, these counters are vulnerable to being\nhit by Sleep Powder or Explosion on the switch.</p>\n<p>Other checks to Exeggutor include Starmie and other Exeggutor. Starmie\ncan check Hidden Power Fire variants or even attempt to use Recover to\nstall out Giga Drain's 8 PP, and is usually the best sleep bait\navailable on a defensive team without Sleep Talk. However, losing\nStarmie to sleep, Explosion, or a critical hit Giga Drain will leave\nCloyster open to set Spikes up. Furthermore, your own Exeggutor can\nswitch into an opposing Exeggutor to threaten it in return with\nExplosion, Sleep Powder, or potentially even Hidden Power Fire. However,\nkeep in mind that your own Exeggutor works best against Giga Drain\nExeggutor, and that furthermore the opposing Exeggutor will also have\nall of these tools to use against you. There are also Pokemon that\nthreaten Exeggutor but cannot wall it or switch in on it easily.\nCharizard does not want to take status or 35-42% damage from Psychic on\nthe switch, but is likely to OHKO with Fire Blast or set up Belly Drum\nif Exeggutor chooses to switch out. Additionally, Heracross cannot\nswitch into 65-77% damage from Psychic, but it often runs Sleep Talk to\nabsorb sleep and forces Exeggutor to switch out with the threat of a\nguaranteed Megahorn OHKO.</p>\n",

Additionally, Parasect isn't a very strong attacker either,\nso basically anything that resists Hidden Power Bug beats it. Basically,\nany decent team can handle Parasect.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The one and only CurseLax. GSC is where the whole concept of CurseLax\noriginated, and it's also where CurseLax functions best. Unlike other\nCurse users, Snorlax's massive HP and Special Defense stats allow it to\navoid being 3HKOed by any unboosted special attack, thereby allowing it\nto Curse up to its heart's content in the face of special moves that\nwould break other Curse users on their unboosted special side. As a\nresult, CurseLax can usually only be stopped by phazing and stalling\ntactics rather than attacking it outright. Snorlax's standard Curse set\nuses Double-Edge as its preferred STAB attack, since the massive 120\nBase Power STAB attack can threaten switch-ins even before a Curse, do\nsolid damage to foes that resist Normal-type moves after only one or two\nCurse boosts, and in the event that your own CurseLax has gotten into a\nCurse war with an opposing Snorlax, a 999 Attack STAB Double-Edge can\n2HKO an opposing 912 Defense Snorlax with a critical hit, something that\nthe next strongest Normal STAB attack, Return, cannot claim. For these\nreasons, the recoil, while occasionally a problem for Snorlax against\nstrong special attackers, is almost always worth the power. Other than\nthe STAB move, Curse and Rest basically define this set; Curse is the\nset's namesake that raises Snorlax's already high Attack while patching\nup its weak Defense, while Rest provides the healing move that is\nmandatory for an effective wall.</p>\n<p>While CurseLax is traditionally thought of as some sort of unstoppable\nmonster capable of mowing entire teams down, the reality is that\nalthough nothing can switch in and immediately threaten an active,\nreasonably healthy Snorlax, there are several Pokemon that outright\nneuter its offensive capabilities. Normal-resisting Pokemon with Curse\nor a phazing move, such as Tyranitar and Skarmory, or Pokemon with high\nDefense and Growl or Charm, such as Miltank and Umbreon, can all easily\nbring CurseLax's gathered momentum to a screeching halt. The choice of\nCurseLax's fourth move reflects how one chooses to approach the fact\nthat CurseLax will inevitably be walled. Sleep Talk is for those who are\ncontent for Snorlax to be useless against Ghost-types and all Cursing or\nphazing Normal resisters, and opt to maximize Snorlax's defensive\navailability by allowing it to attack even while asleep. This is\nespecially useful when walling attackers such as Nidoking and Zapdos,\nwho can otherwise KO a sleeping Snorlax with a lucky critical hit and\nsome smart play. Lovely Kiss is an amazing offensive tool that is\nextremely effective against a single threat. It can completely\nincapacitate one of Snorlax's chief counters, which is likely a Pokemon\nthat does not use Sleep Talk. CurseLax can also choose among two\nprominent coverage moves to tackle Normal resisters. Earthquakes gives\nit the ability to directly damage Ghost-types and do heavy damage to\nRock-types, whereas Fire Blast gives it the ability to get past\nSteel-types, and is usually preferred over Flamethrower because Fire\nBlast can OHKO Forretress and 2HKO Skarmory and Steelix. However, Fire\nBlast's 8 PP is easily exploitable, so Flamethrower can be used for its\nreliability, especially if you want to be able to slowly (but surely) KO\nGengar without worrying about PP. With Fire Blast or Flamethrower, Body\nSlam becomes a viable STAB move of choice, allowing Snorlax to get past\nMiltank with paralysis hax and paralyze the Rock-type switch-ins that\ncan otherwise cause problems with Rock Slide flinches if they outspeed\nSnorlax.</p>\n<p>Although CurseLax isn't an offensive behemoth from the get-go, it serves\nas an incredible all-purpose defensive tank capable of slowing down just\nabout any offensive push the opponent might be attempting. That being\nsaid, Snorlax only lacks offensive strength because of the few common\nthings that neutralize it (which, by the way, are only common because\nCurseLax is common). While it's difficult to outright KO many of these\nthreats, the fact that Snorlax can force switches to these specific\nPokemon can lead to an advantageous double switch. If the opponent is\nusing a Ghost-type to wall Snorlax, you can double switch to Pursuit\nTyranitar and put that Ghost-type in a bind. If it's drawing the likes\nof Miltank and Umbreon, you have a couple of options. A combination of\nSpikes damage and using Double-Edge on the switch can really force these\ntwo into a difficult situation, forcing them to use a lot of Milk Drink\nor Moonlight PP and risk being KOed by a critical hit. In addition,\ndouble switches to the likes of Machamp, Roar Raikou, and Vaporeon can\nallow for an instant offensive push. If the opponent is going to checks\nsuch as Tyranitar and Steelix, Vaporeon and Marowak make excellent\ndouble switch candidates. If Skarmory is the check of choice, a double\nswitch to a mixed attacker such as Nidoking or Dragonite can keep your\noffensive momentum flowing, as can a switch to Roar Raikou if Spikes are\ndown.</p>\n<p>One important note with regards to CurseLax is its potential as the last\nPokemon. When Snorlax is the only Pokemon remaining on your team,\nphazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind will fail, meaning that\nSkarmory and Tyranitar can no longer eliminate Snorlax's Curse boosts\nwith these moves. Last-Poke CurseLax, as it's called, forces stall teams\nto run tactics such as Curse Skarmory, Growl Miltank, or Perish Song\nMisdreavus to avoid losing to a CurseLax saved for the end of the game.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Here is the game's best stallbreaker. You give up some of Snorlax's\ndefensive potential and versatility with this set, since you are\ntypically giving up the Defense boost and ease of use that Curse offers\nfor the raw power that Belly Drum offers from a single turn of setup.\nThis set generally maximizes the chance of a sweep. After using Belly\nDrum, a STAB move is necessary; Body Slam allows Snorlax to paralyze\nSkarmory and most likely 3HKO it after the Attack boost (36-43% damage).\nReturn will guarantee the 3HKO on Skarmory (43%-51% damage) after using\nBelly Drum and can 3HKO Zapdos before using Belly Drum (34%-40% damage).\nDouble-Edge, while risky due to its recoil combined with the health lost\nfrom Belly Drum, will most likely 2HKO Skarmory after a Belly Drum\n(51%-60% damage) and is Snorlax's most powerful STAB attack. The choice\nof STAB is largely a matter of preference since all three moves have\ntheir pros and cons, though Double-Edge is generally shunned for the\nsafer STABs because the recoil makes it more difficult to maintain a\nsweep once Snorlax gets going.</p>\n<p>The third move depends on what else you want Snorlax to do. Earthquake\ngives it coverage against Ghost- and Rock-types, leaving only Skarmory\nable to wall Snorlax after a Belly Drum. Lovely Kiss will let Snorlax\nbeat Skarmory and absolutely destroys teams that use only one Normal\nresist, though it does make life more difficult against Rock-types and\nmakes Pursuit support mandatory in order to deal with Ghost-types. Curse\nis the safe option that makes the Snorlax sweep hardest to pull off, but\nalso gives you a safe setup move to allow Snorlax to function better on\nthe defense. Curse will also allow you to surprise opponents that try to\nstall you out with Growl Miltank and Charm Umbreon, as Belly Drum\nutterly defeats such stall tactics that otherwise work against CurseLax.\nThe fourth move depends on what kind of team you're running. In general,\nyou'll want to use Rest so that Snorlax has some room for error and\nfunction as a wall when you need it to. The beauty of DrumLax as opposed\nto other sweepers in GSC is its ability to Rest up to full health and\ncome back later in the match to threaten to sweep again. However, if\nyou're running a hyper-offensive team that focuses on passing Agility,\nyou may want to forgo Rest for Lovely Kiss to maximize Snorlax's\noffensive potential once it gets a Speed boost from Agility being passed\nto it. If you are using Lovely Kiss instead of Rest, Earthquake must be\nused in the third moveslot.</p>\n<p>Because DrumLax is more offensively oriented than CurseLax, it requires\na much more specific group of teammates to help it set up a sweep. In\ngeneral, DrumLax's number one enemy is Skarmory, who walls it almost\ncompletely barring a 3HKO by a Belly Drum-boosted attack while it\nsleeps. In order to deal with Skarmory, teammates such as Seismic Toss\nHeracross and Pursuit Tyranitar can chip away at Skarmory's HP and force\nit to Rest, therefore making it inactive for the two turns Snorlax needs\nto be able to KO Skarmory after a Belly Drum. Pursuit Tyranitar is\nmandatory if Snorlax is only using a Normal-type attacking move, because\nGhost-types completely wall Snorlax without Pursuit support to snipe\nthem out. Furthermore, if DrumLax is using Body Slam, it can synergize\nwell with other physical sweepers such as Marowak and Machamp who thrive\noff of DrumLax's ability to paralyze Skarmory. DrumLax also loves Heal\nBell support so that it can use Rest to restore its full health, then\nimmediately threaten to sweep without needing to wait out the two Rest\nturns. For this reason, Miltank and Blissey also make great partners,\ndespite their shared Fighting-type weakness with Snorlax. Snorlax also\nhates taking unnecessary damage, as it prevents Snorlax from safely\npulling off a Belly Drum sweep, making Starmie an excellent partner to\nspin away Spikes. In addition, Raikou with Reflect can pass the Defense\nboost Snorlax needs to set up in the face of Rock-types and Explosion\nusers, and Pokemon such as Stun Spore Exeggutor and Thunder Wave Starmie\ncan paralyze members of the opposing team so that Snorlax has the chance\nto use Belly Drum against faster opponents. Teammates that can use Baton\nPass to give Snorlax Agility boosts, such as Jolteon and Smeargle, also\nmake excellent partners.</p>\n<p>Snorlax can make use of Belly Drum in two different ways. The first is\nwhen it is at full health, it can safely set up the move the way it was\nintended to achieve maximum attack at the cost of half of its health.\nThis is the boost that allows Snorlax to break through stalling tactics.\nHowever, Snorlax can also use Belly Drum below half health to force the\nmove to fail and activate the Belly Drum glitch, which causes Snorlax to\ngain a +2 Attack boost with no cost to its health. This boost is handy\nfor when you don't have a Heal Bell user or can't afford to use Rest,\nbut need an Attack boost to start cleaning up the opposing team. Always\nbe aware of when you and your opponent can pull off the glitch so that\nyou can grab a convenient +2 boost and simultaneously prevent your\nopponent from obtaining that same boost.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set sacrifices almost all of Snorlax's defensive utility and\nsweeping potential in order to utilize the element of surprise and\ninstantly threaten just about everything in the GSC metagame. This set\nworks mostly due to the surprise factor; most people expect Snorlax to\nuse Rest along with some sort of setup move, leaving room for one\ncoverage move at the most. This allows Snorlax to catch the opponent by\nsurprise by using Fire Blast on Skarmory, and then nailing a Tyranitar\nswitch-in with Earthquake. Once your opponent has figured out that\nSnorlax is mixed, they'll probably switch to Suicune, Miltank, or their\nown Snorlax, at which point Snorlax can use either Self-Destruct for the\nkill or Double-Edge to wear down these switch-ins. Double-Edge is the\npreferred STAB because it gives you the most power. Unlike Return,\nDouble-Edge is strong enough to 3HKO opposing Snorlax. Body Slam doesn't\neven 3HKO Zapdos, so its low damage output won't force switches the same\nway Double-Edge does, regardless of the paralysis chance. In addition,\ninstead of using Earthquake for Ghost- and Rock-types, you can opt for\nLovely Kiss to go for the two-for-one 'Sleep-and-Explode' deal. Lovely\nKiss is particularly useful for allowing MixLax to get past Growl\nMiltank and Charm Umbreon without having to use Self-Destruct\nspecifically against them. The problem is that Snorlax won't be able to\nheavily dent Rock- or Ghost-types without Earthquake, but Fire Blast is\nalmost mandatory as Steel-types are more common than Rock- and\nGhost-types, and because Skarmory would wall you forever regardless of\nLovely Kiss. For a safer route, you could opt for Rest over\nSelf-Destruct to allow Snorlax to function more effectively as a wall.</p>\n<p>Again, MixLax thrives off the expectations of the opponent to do damage,\nbut even if you see it coming, it can be difficult to find a decent\nanswer to MixLax because of its ability to heavily damage nearly any\nswitch-in. Still, MixLax does have issues getting past some specific\nthreats. Barring a timely critical hit, Snorlax is forced to\nSelf-Destruct on Suicune, Miltank, and Umbreon in order to beat them.\nSnorlax can also be forced to Self-Destruct on Zapdos or opposing\nSnorlax in order to beat them. In addition, despite having Earthquake,\nSnorlax can struggle against bulkier Rock-types and Misdreavus. Having\nSpikes support helps Snorlax take advantage of the many switches it can\nforce, putting troublesome Pokemon (except for Zapdos) into KO range for\nDouble-Edge or Earthquake. Using other Exploders such as Cloyster and\nExeggutor can also be useful for eliminating threats such as Zapdos that\ncan otherwise do heavy damage to Snorlax. Pursuit Tyranitar helps pick\noff Misdreavus and chip away at Zapdos to make life easier for MixLax.\nIn addition, mixed sweepers such as Nidoking and Dragonite love\nSnorlax's ability to blow up on and KO any one of these threats. Miltank\nin particular makes many mixed sweepers' lives extremely difficult, and\nit generally isn't easy to target with Explosion. To use MixLax\neffectively, it's also important to cover the defensive threats that\nSnorlax usually steps in against. Sleep Talk Raikou in particular walls\nthe Electric- and Water-types that Snorlax is usually switched into. In\ngeneral, however, MixLax isn't typically used for any specific offensive\ngoal, and doesn't necessarily need any sort of specific support. It is a\nself-sufficient offensive threat that works best as a lure in order to\ncatch opponents off guard.</p>\n"

Snorlax is always an\noffensive and defensive boon to a team, and while it does have some\nunfortunate weaknesses (namely mediocre Defense, low Speed, and reliance\non Normal STAB for damage output), its strong points make it the force\nthat defines the GSC metagame. Seriously, Skarmory is only good because\nit walls Snorlax's most common sets, and the legendary Electric-types\nfrequently run Thunder over Thunderbolt almost entirely because Thunder\ncan threaten to KO Snorlax after Spikes damage or a critical hit.\nSnorlax is mandatory on basically every serious GSC team.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Other than what has been mentioned above, a mixed attacker set with\nCurse or Lovely Kiss as the fourth move instead of Self-Destruct can be\nan effective form of offense against many teams. With Lovely Kiss,\nSnorlax gets past Miltank and Charm Umbreon. With Curse, it has an\neasier time getting past Zapdos and Suicune. However, the lack of\nSelf-Destruct on the mixed set really dampens Snorlax's ability to score\nsurprise KOs and toy with the opponent. A mixed attacking Snorlax could\nalso run Thunder in order to destroy Cloyster switch-ins, while 2HKOing\nSkarmory and threatening paralysis against mixed walls such as Miltank\nand Suicune. However, Thunder leaves you in a bind against Steelix,\nunlike Fire Blast. Thunder is best used alongside Surf for this very\nreason; as an added bonus, it also screws Rhydon over, who is uncommon,\nbut nonetheless one of the most reliable Snorlax counters in the game\nwith its heavy damage output and meaty Defense that prevents 3HKOs from\nSnorlax's unboosted Earthquakes. However, a Thunder and Surf mixed\nSnorlax finds itself in a bind against Ghost-types and Tyranitar, and\nrelies heavily on Thunder paralysis to beat Suicune, Miltank, and\nUmbreon. Snorlax can also run Toxic on sets with Double-Edge and\nFlamethrower in order to spread poison around the opponent's team.\nAlthough Gengar is immune to both Toxic and Double-Edge and takes paltry\ndamage from Flamethrower, it can't do much to Snorlax in return unless\nit Explodes, and will eventually succumb to Flamethrower if continually\nused to wall Snorlax. However, just as with many mixed Snorlax sets,\nMiltank and Suicune shut Toxic Snorlax down completely barring a\ncritical hit.</p>\n<p>Snorlax is capable of running Fire Blast or Flamethrower on Belly Drum\nsets to threaten Skarmory switch-ins with instant damage and possibly\nbluff a Curse set, since Snorlax will usually not use a Fire-type move\non a Belly Drum set. Unfortunately, the lack of Earthquake to OHKO\nGhost- and Rock-types can be very frustrating for a DrumLax that would\notherwise be in position to sweep. In addition, the Fire-type move is\noften unnecessary, as it is possible to put DrumLax in a position such\nthat it can KO Skarmory with its boosted Normal-type STAB moves.\nSubstitute is a usable, albeit unconventional, option for CurseLax in\norder to avoid the Attack-lowering effects of Growl and Charm, which can\nbe used by Miltank and Umbreon to stall CurseLax out of PP. Lovely Kiss\nalso allows CurseLax to get past Miltank and Umbreon; however, unlike\nLovely Kiss, Substitute is not ruined by a timely switch to a Sleep Talk\nuser. Substitute is also useless against most of Snorlax's other checks.\nSnorlax makes good use of Counter on Belly Drum sets to punish foes that\nbeat down on it and to avoid being phazed while it is asleep. Counter is\nalso useful on CurseLax to allow it to KO another CurseLax by surprise.\nShadow Ball and Dynamic Punch are very niche coverage moves for very\nspecific threats. Shadow Ball 2HKOs Misdreavus without setup, but has\nlittle use outside of that specific match-up, and Earthquake hits Gengar\nharder. On the other hand, Dynamic Punch is more generally useful; it\ncan ruin overconfident Tyranitar users who try to go for Rock Slide\nflinches, and also allows CurseLax to confuse and possibly beat Miltank,\nUmbreon, and even paralyzed Skarmory. However, Dynamic Punch leaves you\nhelpless at the hands of Ghost-types and at the mercy of Dynamic Punch's\nabysmal 8 PP and 50% accuracy. Aside from the aforementioned options,\nthere really isn't anything else worth using in Snorlax's arsenal.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Skarmory is often touted as the number one check to Snorlax. It resists\nNormal-type moves, boasts an immunity to Earthquake, has an unbelievable\nDefense stat, and can use Whirlwind to force Snorlax out and relinquish\nits boosts from Curse and Belly Drum. However, Snorlax can use Lovely\nKiss or Fire Blast to beat it. Because Skarmory is hardly a universal\nSnorlax check, at least two good answers to Snorlax are necessary for\nany competitive GSC team, especially as Snorlax can utilize Lovely Kiss\nto put one of your checks out of commission. Aside from Skarmory,\nSteelix performs a similar role. Unlike Skarmory, it shrugs off even +3\nDouble-Edges, but it's still susceptible to Fire Blast and takes a lot\nof damage from a boosted Earthquake. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and\nRhydon don't like Earthquake, but they easily tank its Normal-type\nmoves, use Roar to force Snorlax out, and can even use Curse alongside\nSnorlax. Misdreavus takes advantage of its Normal-type immunity and the\nfact that it avoids being 3HKOed by unboosted Earthquakes in order to\nswitch into Snorlax and force it out with the threat of Perish trap.\nHowever, Misdreavus loses if Snorlax is the Belly Drum variant with\nEarthquake. Gengar is an interesting check; it's not exactly a good\nwall, but it can outspeed Snorlax even after an Agility boost and then\nExplode on it. It also gets Destiny Bond to take Earthquake variants\ndown with it. Furthermore, it gets Ice Punch and Hypnosis to go for the\nfreeze while wasting the PP of CurseLax variants without Earthquake.</p>\n<p>Growl Miltank and Charm Umbreon make solid walls for Curse and mixed\nvariants of Snorlax, stalling out even the dreaded last-Poke CurseLax\nwith ease; however, DrumLax completely ruins their plans. A well-timed\nLovely Kiss allows Snorlax to beat these checks regardless of its\nmoveset. Suicune can take even a max Attack Return from Snorlax and then\nproceed to phaze it; it can also take anything that the mixed variant\ncan throw out. However, it does take a lot of damage from Curse-boosted\nDouble-Edges, so it isn't recommended as a primary Snorlax check so much\nas it is as a fall-back. Explosion users such as Exeggutor, Cloyster,\nand Forretress can threaten to KO Snorlax or leave it irreparably\nwounded. Cloyster and Forretress in particular can survive anything that\nstandard DrumLax can throw at them and proceed to Explode in its face,\nwhich is very useful if Snorlax manages to get an Agility boost passed\nto it. Finally, if one's own CurseLax uses Double-Edge, it can step in\nto check opposing CurseLax. CurseLax, regardless of the STAB move it\nchooses, can also check any variant of mixed Snorlax. Using CurseLax to\ncheck opposing Snorlax is even easier if you use a variant with Sleep\nTalk, Lovely Kiss, or even Counter.</p>\n<p>On the offense, Marowak, Machamp, and Heracross make excellent double\nswitches in the event of an expected Snorlax switch-in. In addition,\nVaporeon with Acid Armor sets up unabashedly in CurseLax's face, and\nwith Hydro Pump, a single Growth is all it needs to 3HKO the big lug.\nSunny Day Houndoom also 3HKOs Snorlax on the special side after it sets\nup sun, and can also use Counter to punish it for attacking. Snorlax\nfails to OHKO a healthy Houndoom with a Curse-boosted Double-Edge, which\nmeans that many Snorlax variants will be forced to risk being killed by\nCounter in order to avoid being KOed by Fire Blast. A more conventional\nway to kill Snorlax, however, is to use a combination of Spikes and an\nElectric-type. Zapdos threatens to straight-up KO Snorlax with a\ncombination of Thunder spam and Spikes damage on the switch, whereas\nRaikou, with its slightly weaker Thunder and lower physical defense,\nrequires more finesse via the use of Roar to accumulate Spikes damage on\nSnorlax.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This Cloyster is easy to use. Come in on a weak physical attacker or\nwall, set up Spikes, fire away with Surf or Toxic, and switch out when\nthe opponent brings in one of Cloyster's counters. Spikes is an easy\nfirst choice and is the main draw to using Cloyster. The damage that\nSpikes deals per switch will punish opposing teams that try to double\nswitch in order to gain better match-ups. Grounded prediction-oriented\nPokemon such as Nidoking, Marowak, Machamp, and Rhydon will especially\nsuffer from Spikes damage. Over a longer match, the damage from Spikes\ncan play a key role in wearing the opponent down into KO range for\nboosting sweepers and will help grind down opposing stall teams. Surf\nprovides an excellent offensive option for Cloyster to exercise against\nany Misdreavus, Gengar, Rhydon, or Skarmory hoping to switch into an\nExplosion. Surf is one of the main differences between Cloyster and\nForretress. Unlike Forretress, Cloyster can go on the offensive against\na wide range of opponents. Surf allows Cloyster to act as a solid\nMarowak counter on teams that lack Skarmory and as an additional support\noption against Snorlax. Cloyster also makes a pretty good Quagsire\ncounter. Toxic is incredibly useful for hitting Water-type spinners such\nas Starmie and opposing Cloyster. Ice Beam can be used for super\neffective coverage against Zapdos and Exeggutor, but Toxic is generally\na much better option. Explosion is the final option and gives Closyter\nan ace in the hole against Starmie, Raikou, Suicune, Snorlax, Blissey,\nand Zapdos. Explosion, used effectively, can help prevent Cloyster's\nteam from being swept in emergency situations.</p>\n<p>With the right support, Cloyster can be a useful choice for both\noffensive and defensive teams looking for a Spikes setter. Cloyster\nreally enjoys support from Ghost-types that can block Rapid Spin,\nthereby keeping Spikes on the field for as long as possible. Misdreavus\nis the best option as it can serve as a very effective stallbreaker and\ncan take hits better than Gengar. Misdreavus is also not weak to common\nPsychic- and Ground-type moves. Misdreavus's ability to force switches\nthrough the threat of Mean Look and Perish Song, combined with\nCloyster's ability to lay Spikes, can easily rack up damage on opposing\nteams. Cloyster also enjoys support from more offensive Pokemon that\nbenefit from Spikes support. Mixed and set-up sweepers such as Zapdos,\nRaikou, Nidoking, and Snorlax love the extra damage Spikes provides. The\nadditional passive damage will allow these sweepers to nail important\nKOs against opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax.</p>\n<p>Cloyster absolutely loves partners that can force switches. Phazing\nmoves, including Roar and Whirlwind, will force the opponent to switch\noften, racking up large amounts of Spikes damage. Phazers such as\nRaikou, Rhydon, Steelix, and Skarmory all make wonderful partners.\nRaikou is especially noteworthy for its ability to slam Starmie with a\nsuper effective Thunderbolt or Thunder. Few teams will carry more than\none or two counters to Raikou, allowing for opportunities to switch in\nand phaze. Cloyster also works well with Toxic support. The extra damage\nfrom Spikes can allow Toxic to KO an opponent one turn sooner. Forcing\nopponents to use Rest instead of attacking is another benefit to using\nToxic. When using Spikes it is important to keep the long-term benefit\nin mind.</p>\n<p>Offensive Cloyster also works well on teams centered around Explosion.\nFast-paced teams that rely on Explosion love the Spikes support Cloyster\ncan provide as well as its ability to draw out and Explode on Starmie.\nWhile Exploding on Starmie will allow it to use its faster Rapid Spin,\nit will open up a hole other Explosion users or sweepers can exploit.\nCloyster's ideal use on an Explosion team would be to set up Spikes and\nthen Explode or attack against an opposing wall or dangerous switch-in\nsuch as Snorlax. While Explosion teams are risky, they can also be\nsurprisingly effective. Cloyster helps nullify some of that risk by\nforcing the opponent to play in predictable ways, such as always\nbringing in Starmie as Cloyster sets up Spikes. The extra Spikes support\nfor suicide teams can also be very effective in nailing certain\nhard-to-KO opponents with Explosion.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Cloyster is one of only four Pokemon that can use both Spikes and Rapid\nSpin. Combining the roles of both a Spikes user and spinner turns\nCloyster into an effective utility Pokemon that can be used on both\ndefensive and offensive teams. Spikes allows Cloyster to provide team\nsupport through passive damage. Rapid Spin allows Cloyster to clear\nSpikes from its own side of the field. With a combination of Rapid Spin\nand Spikes, Cloyster can fulfill two duties at the same time--clearing\nand laying entry hazards.</p>\n<p>The third slot is for Surf as the obligatory STAB move. Surf provides a\nconstant option to wear down opponents when necessary. Surf is suggested\nover Ice Beam because it does more damage against spinners such as\nopposing Cloyster and Forretress; it also offers better coverage against\nGround- and Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Steelix, and Rhydon. The\nability to go on the offensive with Surf, combined with Cloyster's\nbetter Speed, are the primary reasons for using Cloyster over Forretress\nas a defensive spinner and Spikes setter. The last slot is for a move of\nyour choice. Toxic is the suggested option because it will give Cloyster\nan option against bulky Water-types that take little damage from Surf.\nToxic will also force certain opponents to use Rest instead of attacking\nor to switch out to avoid more damage. Rest is useful to restore\nCloyster's health, but without a cleric it's virtually useless. A\nsleeping Cloyster is nothing but dead weight and will often fail to\nsurvive the two turns required to wake up. However, Rest will allow\nCloyster to become a 100% Steelix counter if there are no entry hazards\non your side of the field. Ice Beam can be used if you desire super\neffective coverage against Dragonite, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, but Toxic\nis a far superior option overall. It is also good to keep in mind that\nCloyster cannot use Explosion and Rapid Spin on the same set.</p>\n<p>Because its primary goal is to keep Spikes on the field, Cloyster will\nalways want partners that can spinblock effectively or KO opposing\nspinners. Getting rid of opposing Starmie and Cloyster is paramount if\nyou want to be able to keep Spikes on the field. Misdreavus is wonderful\nas a spinblocker because it can force out both Cloyster and Forretress\nwith the threat of Mean Look and Perish Song; it also has the benefit of\nnot being weak to Starmie's Psychic like Gengar is. Its Ghost typing\ngives Misdreavus an immunity to Explosion and Rapid Spin, as well as a\nresistance to Hidden Power Bug. Misdreavus will need to be careful of\nswitching into a Toxic or Surf though; it will be easily worn down if it\nisn't careful. Raikou is always a great option because it can easily KO\nStarmie and Cloyster with a STAB Thunder. Raikou also works as a\nwonderful phazing partner and can switch in on the Electric-type attacks\nthat Cloyster fears so strongly. Tyranitar is a wonderful partner for\nCloyster and spinners in general. Its powerful Pursuit will nail\nGhost-types that switch into Cloyster to block Rapid Spin. Once any\nspinblockers are gone, Cloyster will be able to remove Spikes with\nimpunity.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster's purpose in OU revolves around one move--Spikes. Cloyster is\none of only two OU Pokemon that can effectively lay Spikes, thereby\ndealing 12.5% damage per switch-in on all Pokemon, barring Flying-types.\nAs a Spikes user, Cloyster boasts a decently powerful Surf and\nExplosion. These two moves in conjunction give it the ability to support\nits team offensively once Spikes are on the field. Cloyster also has\ndecent Speed, which it can use to outrun and Explode on threats that its\nmain competition, Forretress, cannot. Cloyster's better offensive\nsynergy, STAB, and more dangerous Explosion are the primary reasons to\nuse it over Forretress as a Spikes setter.</p>\n<p>While Cloyster shines in its niche role as a user of both Spikes and\nRapid Spin, it still has several glaring weaknesses. Cloyster's low HP\nand Special Defense, combined with a lack of reliable recovery outside\nof Leftovers, prevent it from taking more than a handful of attacks\nbefore being KOed. Forretress has more defensive staying power because\nof key resistances to Psychic- and Normal-type attacks, an immunity to\nToxic, and only one weakness. Forretress has one other major selling\npoint over Cloyster--Hidden Power Bug. Starmie is one of the most\nprominent spinners in OU, and with Hidden Power Bug Forretress can nail\nan important 2HKO after one round of Spikes damage. However, despite\nCloyster's issues, it can still provide unique advantages as a Spikes\nuser and should never be overlooked for a spot on either offensive or\ndefensive teams.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Beyond the stated moves, Cloyster has a few other interesting options it\ncan use to surprise the opponent. Clamp is a good option when using\nExplosion because it will prevent the opponent from switching out to a\nSteel- or Ghost-type. Hidden Power Electric or Grass can give Cloyster\nan edge against opposing Cloyster in Rapid Spin and Spikes wars. Hidden\nPower will do more damage than Toxic right off the bat but it will fail\nto do significant damage to Starmie. Icy Wind is an option against\nfaster opponents to lower their Speed. Icy Wind's Speed drop will give\nCloyster an edge over Tentacruel, Raikou, and Starmie especially. The\nability to lower the opponent's Speed can also boost Cloyster's chances\nof using Explosion before the opponent can set up Reflect, use Rapid\nSpin, or KO Cloyster. Reflect is another decent option for Cloyster. The\nextra Defense can let Cloyster survive a little bit longer and will give\nits team a nice boost when it switches out. However, it should be noted\nthat like Explosion, Reflect is illegal with Rapid Spin.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Cloyster's entire purpose is to keep Spikes on the field; therefore,\npreventing this is the easiest way to check Cloyster. Rapid Spin users\nsuch as Starmie, Forretress, and opposing Cloyster make your own\nCloyster's life a nightmare and decrease its ability to support its\nteam. Starmie is not afraid of Cloyster's Surf and can easily switch in\nand remove Spikes with Rapid Spin. Opposing Cloyster, with their high\nDefense and resistance to Surf, are able to not only remove Spikes but\nalso set up their own. Forretress is bulkier than both Starmie and\nCloyster, is immune to Toxic, and resists Explosion. Like Cloyster,\nForretress can both remove opposing Spikes and lay its own. However,\nbecause Cloyster's Surf will 3HKO, Forretress will not be able to take\non Cloyster directly.</p>\n<p>Beyond spinning, Cloyster is easily checked by powerful offensive\nopponents. While Cloyster boasts sky-high Defense, it has gutter-worthy\nSpecial Defense. Powerful Electric-types such as Raikou and Zapdos are\nespecially threatening thanks to Thunderbolt's easy OHKO. Ghost-types,\nsuch as Gengar and Misdreavus, also make good checks because they have\ndecent Special Defense, access to Electric-type moves, and the ability\nto block Rapid Spin and Explosion. Gengar will always OHKO with Thunder,\nand Misdreavus with Thunder can OHKO after one turn of Spikes damage.\nCloyster, however, will seldom try to stay in on these opponents,\npreferring to use Surf or Toxic on the switch and then switching away to\na fellow phazer or special wall. Powerful physical attacks will also\nspell doom for Cloyster. STAB Rock Slide will do a great deal of damage\nto Cloyster, but no Rock-types will enjoy switching in on Cloyster's\nSTAB Surf. Keep in mind that using walls or tanks to check Cloyster is\nalways a risky proposition because of the threat from Explosion and the\npossibility of Cloyster setting up Spikes or using Rapid Spin.</p>\n",

Note that if Starmie or Raikou get\nparalyzed, they are no longer legitimate counters.</p>\n<p>Other options for counters can include Pokemon with high Defense and/or\nCharm, Reflect, or Growl--Pokemon like Miltank, Umbreon, Donphan, and\nSuicune are examples--but remember that they'll take two large hits\nbefore being able to act. Even in these instances, Tauros is usually\njust a critical hit away from breaking through.</p>\n",

This set will stop numerous special attackers and setup sweepers\nsuch as Growth Vaporeon, Zapdos, Gengar, Suicune, and Growth Jolteon.\nRaikou will also serve as an effective check to any Misdreavus trying to\nPerish trap. While Roar phazes opponents and racks up entry hazard\ndamage, Raikou can also threaten opponents with STAB Thunder. It can\nchoose between both Thunder and Thunderbolt. Thunder has extra power and\na 30% paralysis chance, while Thunderbolt is more accurate and has more\nPP. Reflect will halve the damage from physical sweepers such as\nSnorlax, Marowak, and Heracross, making it easier to switch out to a\ncounter. Reflect will also greatly benefit Snorlax trying to set up\nBelly Drum, but without Hidden Power, Raikou will be unable to threaten\nExeggutor or Ground-types. Hidden Power Ice and Water are both options\nover Reflect if Raikou needs the extra coverage. Rest is in the fourth\nslot to keep Raikou alive once its health has become dangerously low.\nStatus from opponents, especially paralysis, will still be a pain, and\nwithout Sleep Talk, Raikou will be forced to either switch out or wait\nfor the sleep from rest to end. Raikou's Rest is incredibly fast and\nwith its superior bulk opponents will often fail to KO or significantly\ndamage Raikou as it regains its health before they can attack.</p>\n<p>Raikou is, without a doubt, the best offensive phazer in OU. With Spikes\nsupport, it will easily rack up damage from forced switches and\noffensive pressure. Cloyster makes a great partner since it has Spikes,\nsuper effective STAB against most Ground-types, high Defense, and\nExplosion to open holes in the opponent's team. Forretress is a less\nsolid teammate because of its inability to check Ground-types, but it is\nbetter geared towards providing long-term Spikes support for Raikou.\nBoth Skarmory and Suicune are excellent phazing partners. Skarmory will\ncover Raikou's Ground weakness, while Raikou can absorb powerful\nElectric attacks, such as Thunder, aimed at Skarmory. Skarmory's high\nDefense and ability to wall Snorlax complements Raikou's strong special\nbulk and ability to damage some of Skarmory's key checks, namely Zapdos.\nSuicune offers great mixed bulk and long-term recovery. Raikou, Suicune,\nand Skarmory form a potent defensive combo that few OU threats will be\nable to break. Because of its high Speed, Raikou is vulnerable to\nstatus, especially paralysis. Without Sleep Talk, it will really\nappreciate Heal Bell support to remove sleep from Rest. Miltank is\narguably the best choice as a Heal Bell user, since it boasts high\nDefense and instant recovery in Milk Drink.</p>\n"

This means that Raikou will almost always have a\nchance to hammer the opponent before they can fire back. Incredibly fast\nrecovery in Rest and the ability to continue attacking opponents with\nThunder once asleep make Raikou a potent tank. Rather than phazing\ncommon special threats such as Zapdos, Gengar, Growth Vaporeon, and\nExeggutor this set aims to abuse Raikou's great tanking ability. This\nRaikou set will also prevent Skarmory, Starmie, and Suicune from\nphazing, or Rapid Spinning in Starmie's case. Switching into this set\ncan be deadly as Raikou can hit the opponent very hard twice before they\ncan even move. The difference between using Thunder or Thunderbolt comes\ndown to the classic argument of accuracy versus raw power. Thunderbolt\nwill provide more consistency but Thunder will provide the power\nnecessary to muscle through opposing tanks such as Zapdos. The paralysis\nchance from Thunder is beneficial in general, but its low accuracy and\nPP are a pain, especially in longer matches. Hidden Power Ice and Water\nare both great options for this set. Hidden Power Ice provides super\neffective coverage against Exeggutor, Ground-types, and Dragonite.\nHowever, Hidden Power Water will hit certain Ground-types such as\nSteelix and Rhydon much harder. One side note regarding Hidden Power\nWater\u2014the IV drop from using Water over Ice will cause many moves to KO\nRaikou more often and more quickly than if it used Hidden Power Ice.

Skarmory makes\na great Snorlax check and has the added benefit of providing physically\ndefensive synergy with Raikou. Skarmory will check Snorlax with its\never-useful Whirlwind, while Suicune will provide additional phazing\nsupport against any pesky Ground-types. Not only does Exeggutor resist\nEarthquake, but it also threatens most Ground-types, including Quagsire,\nwith STAB Giga Drain. The paralysis rate from Thunder can help out\nslower attackers such as Marowak and Rhydon. Physical threats such as\nthese will also give Raikou's team an option against opposing Raikou and\nBlissey. Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress is also nice, as the\nadditional damage from Spikes against threats like Exeggutor and\nGround-types is very welcome.</p>\n"

However, STAB\nThunder, even when resisted, is stronger than a neutral Crunch.\nConsidering Thunder's high paralysis chance, Crunch is usually not worth\ndropping Hidden Power for Raikou match-ups. Hidden Power Grass over\nHidden Power Ice or Water will give Quagsire a nasty surprise if it\nshould come in on Raikou. Rhydon and Marowak are also covered by Hidden\nPower Grass. However, losing out on the super effective coverage from\nHidden Power Ice against Nidoking and Exeggutor is less than preferable.\nToxic is a possibility to wear down Snorlax and any walls that switch\nin. However, Thunder is often powerful enough to render Toxic\nunnecessary; giving up Reflect, and thereby leaving Raikou totally and\ncompletely walled by Nidoking and Steelix, is usually not worth the\ntrouble of adding Toxic, either.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Raikou easily checks a large swath of the metagame, but some opponents\nwill flip the tables on the electric tiger. Snorlax is the defining\nmember of OU and threatens nearly everything that tries to come in,\nincluding Raikou. Even if Raikou has Reflect, Snorlax will still be able\nto set up with Curse or paralyze Raikou with Body Slam. As such, Raikou\nwill almost always be forced to switch out of Snorlax, giving the latter\nan extra turn to either set up, attack, or switch to another teammate.\nWith its wonderful Electric immunity, Quagsire is an excellent Raikou\ncheck as long as the latter doesn't pack Hidden Power Grass. Quagsire\neasily threatens with Earthquake and can set up with Belly Drum as\nRaikou switches in fear of being severely damaged. Rhydon and Marowak\ncan come in on a predicted Thunder and threaten Raikou with a super\neffective Earthquake. However, both will need to be wary of switching in\non Hidden Power. Steelix also makes a good check to Raikou as long as it\ndoesn't use Hidden Power Water. Even if Raikou has Reflect up, Steelix\ncan phaze with Roar, potentially racking up Spikes damage. Jolteon\nresists Thunder and can use RestTalk Raikou as an opportunity to set up\nAgility or Substitute, then Baton Pass to a Ground-type such as Marowak\nor Rhydon that can come in and fire away with STAB Earthquake. However,\nJolteon won't be able to set up against phazing Raikou at all, and it\nespecially won't like the 30% paralysis chance from Thunder. Blissey\nalso deserves a mention as a check because of its ridiculous Special\nDefense and HP, as it can also use Light Screen to completely neuter\nRaikou and go for the freeze with Ice Beam.</p>\n",

Also, be aware\nthat defending Pokemon have maximum values (without a nature boost) for\nall stats in GSC.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 46.08% -- 54.01% -- 4.47% chance to\n2HKO with Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 32.01% -- 37.77% -- 0.12% chance to\n3HKO with Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 45.55% -- 53.44% -- 1.12% chance to\n2HKO with Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 41.69% -- 49.13% -- guaranteed 3HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 39.93% -- 46.86% -- guaranteed 3HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 44.02% -- 51.91% -- guaranteed 3HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Tyranitar 86.10% -- 101.24% -- 10.26% chance\nto OHKO</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Steelix 63.17% -- 74.50% -- guaranteed 2HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 42.49% -- 50.14% -- guaranteed 3HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, being close to 2HKOs is not ideal, but with some team support\nand a little bit of residual damage, these KOs can become a reality.\nAdditionally, Marowak runs Rock Slide to 2HKO Zapdos. Hidden Power Bug\nis the final coverage move, and it allows Marowak to OHKO Exeggutor as\nit switches in (although it is just short of being a guaranteed KO).\nHowever, if Marowak is paired up with Heal Bell support, Hidden Power\ncan be forgone for Rest to allow Marowak the ability to heal off damage\nand make a second attempt at wallbreaking. Finally, Swords Dance is the\nmove that allows Marowak to transform from an instant offensive threat\nto a hole-punching wallbreaker by raising its Attack to the 999 cap.\nHowever, Swords Dance can be very difficult to set up, and even after a\nSwords Dance boost, Marowak can miss out on guaranteed OHKOs against\nimportant foes, as illustrated in the damage calculations to follow.\nNote that, in the following damage calculations, Marowak has used Swords\nDance to boost its Attack two stages to reach the maximum possible\nAttack stat of 999.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 90.25% -- 106.12% -- 38.46% chance to\nOHKO</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 60.23% -- 70.94% -- guaranteed 2HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 89.06% -- 104.58% -- 30.77% chance to\nOHKO</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 81.64% -- 95.78% -- guaranteed 2HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 77.89% -- 91.42% -- guaranteed 2HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 86.26% -- 101.27% -- 10.26% chance to\nOHKO</li>\n<li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 82.44% -- 97.17% -- guaranteed 2HKO\nwith Leftovers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, the secret to using Swords Dance is to first put the appropriate\nsupport in place; a defensive landscape with a lot of paralysis and\nresidual damage allows Marowak to easily clean up, as do dual screens\nand passing Agility boosts. However, one crucial moment to consider\nusing Swords Dance without a huge amount of support is when you believe\nthe opponent will be switching to Skarmory. Skarmory takes very little\ndamage from any of Marowak's unboosted attacks, but after Swords Dance\nboosting Marowak's Attack to 999, Rock Slide does 43%-50% to Skarmory,\nwhich is a solid 3HKO. Even if Skarmory tries to use Whirlwind to phaze\nor Curse to reduce Rock Slide's damage to below the 3HKO threshold\n(29%-34%), the 27% flinch rate (factoring in accuracy) makes KOing\nSkarmory possible. However, unless you use Swords Dance on the switch,\nSkarmory can easily tank whatever Marowak has to dish out while\nwhittling away its health with Drill Pecks, and attempting to play for\nthe flinch against a +1 Skarmory can be risky thanks to its boosted\nDrill Peck.</p>\n<p>One thing to note about the Swords Dance set is that, due to a bug in\nGSC, the Attack stat before the Thick Club boost must be 255 or lower.\nOtherwise, after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak's Attack stat after the\nThick Club boost will roll over to something hilarious like 8 instead of\nsimply capping at 999. That kind of Attack stat barely scares a Level 2\nRattata, let alone the top physical walls of GSC. Using Hidden Power Bug\nforces the use of a 13 Attack DV (the GSC equivalent to an IV), which\nautomatically sets Marowak's Attack at 254. However, if you decide\nagainst using Hidden Power on Swords Dance Marowak for whatever reason,\nbe sure to lower Marowak's Attack stat, either by lowering the Attack DV\nto 13 or by reducing Stat Experience (roughly equivalent to EVs) to\nachieve 255 Attack.</p>\n<p>Marowak has poor HP, low Speed, and no Leftovers. Therefore, if Marowak\ntakes any hits not deliberately planned for, its ability to function\ngoes down the drain. For this reason, Marowak needs to be brought in on\npredicted double switches to ensure it isn't switching in on attacks.\nPokemon that can bait good match-ups for Marowak to switch into are\nexcellent teammates. Gengar and Zapdos are good at baiting Raikou, which\nis forced to switch out or risk being OHKOed by Marowak's Earthquake. In\naddition, Rapid Spin from a Pokemon such as Starmie is incredibly\nwelcome support to pair with Marowak, since Spikes damage is terrible\nfor Marowak to be taking every time it switches in. Paralysis support\nfrom Thunder Wave Zapdos or Stun Spore Exeggutor is great for mitigating\nMarowak's poor Speed and preventing it from taking as many hits. Passing\nAgility to Marowak is another way to mitigate its poor Speed. In early\nGSC, using Jolteon to pass Agility to Marowak was such a prominent combo\nthat it was dubbed &quot;JoltWak.&quot; Finally, passing screens to Marowak,\nparticularly Light Screen, can allow it to tank more hits while setting\nup Swords Dance and dishing out hits. Light Screen is the recommended\nscreen to use, as it allows Marowak to tank Suicune's Surfs and Zapdos's\nHidden Powers, although Reflect support can allow Marowak to do a better\njob of tanking Snorlax's Double-Edges and Skarmory's Drill Pecks.</p>\n<p>Of course, Rest can be used to mitigate Marowak's frailty by allowing it\nto recover from prior damage, something most Marowak cannot do\notherwise. This allows you to be a bit more daring with when you choose\nto bring Marowak in, although you still want to avoid bringing it in on\nany kind of attacking move if you can. However, if Marowak chooses to\nforgo Hidden Power for Rest, it MUST be paired with either Miltank or\nBlissey to provide Heal Bell support. Otherwise, Marowak will never be\nable to wake up from its nap, as it is too frail. Additionally, it is\nalso a good idea to pair Rest Marowak with Pursuit support from a\nPokemon such as Umbreon or Tyranitar. This is because, without Hidden\nPower, Marowak will not be able to damage Exeggutor switch-ins.</p>\n"

However, Marowak is very frail and very slow, and despite\nits impressive attacking strength, it still fails to guarantee OHKOs\nagainst several prominent threats even after a Swords Dance boost.\nTherefore, a lot of prediction and team support is required to get\nMarowak to perform well on a team. However, when everything does come\ntogether for Marowak to work properly, it can single-handedly demolish\nthe opposing team.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Using Body Slam over Hidden Power on the Swords Dance set allows Marowak\nto create its own paralysis support, but forces Marowak to miss out on\nthat crucial OHKO against Exeggutor. Fire Blast could be used over\nSwords Dance and possibly paired with Body Slam to make Marowak an\nall-out attacker. Fire Blast handily 3HKOes Skarmory without requiring\nthe use of a boosting move beforehand, but that's about all it's good\nfor. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Hidden Power Bug on the Swords\nDance set to OHKO Heracross while still 2HKOing Exeggutor and nearly\nensuring an OHKO against Exeggutor after a Swords Dance boost. Finally,\nMarowak can attempt to use a RestTalk set to give it some semblance of\nlongevity. However, RestTalk Marowak hardly compares to other RestTalk\nusers since its defenses, typing, and lack of Leftovers recovery prevent\nit from switching in very easily. Thus, it's less of a status-absorbing\ntank and more of a watered-down sweeper.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Skarmory is one of the best counters to Marowak, as it doesn't fear\nanything Marowak can dish out aside from Swords Dance-boosted Rock\nSlides and the uncommon Fire Blast. Even if Marowak has used Swords\nDance to threaten with Rock Slide, Skarmory can use Whirlwind to phaze,\nchip away at Marowak's health with Drill Peck (which only does 22%-26%\nto Marowak, but every bit of damage counts), or even use Curse to take\nonly 29%-34% damage from +2 Rock Slides (not even a guaranteed 4HKO with\nLeftovers) while threatening to hit back with boosted Drill Pecks.\nSuicune is also an excellent Marowak counter, especially with a RestTalk\nset. Suicune threatens to easily 2HKO Marowak, although it does take\nheavy damage when switching into an Earthquake. With Sleep Talk,\nhowever, Suicune is able to freely use Rest to shrug off those\nEarthquakes while still threatening to 2HKO Marowak. Cloyster is another\ngood switch-in, but unlike Suicune it takes the same damage from both\nRock Slide and Earthquake, so baiting Rock Slides with Zapdos does\nnothing to make Cloyster's switch in any easier. Furthermore, Cloyster\ndoes not last nearly as long as Suicune, so it is much easier for\nMarowak to wear Cloyster down on the switch. Starmie and Vaporeon are\nother solid checks that can force Marowak out by threatening to 2HKO\nwith Surf, but they must be wary when switching in, as Earthquake\nhandily 2HKOes them and can OHKO after a Swords Dance boost.</p>\n<p>Aside from Skarmory and Water-types, Exeggutor can switch into anything\nexcept for Hidden Power Bug and then threaten to use Sleep Powder,\nExplosion, or a strong special attack. If nothing else, Exeggutor poses\nenough of a threat to Marowak to bait Hidden Power Bug, which in turn\nmakes it much easier for Water-types to switch into Marowak. Heracross\nresists Earthquake and only really fears Hidden Power Flying while\ndealing heavy damage to Marowak in return with Megahorn. However,\nMegahorn is an unlikely 2HKO against Marowak (it deals 45%-52%) whereas,\nafter a Swords Dance boost, Marowak is guaranteed to 2HKO Heracross with\nEarthquake. In addition, Zapdos is somewhat of a Marowak check. Zapdos's\nHidden Power Grass or Ice will do 43%-50% damage to standard Marowak, so\nit cannot outpace Marowak's damage output in a one-on-one situation\nunless it gets very high damage rolls, but it can do significant damage\nto Marowak while avoiding being OHKOed by Rock Slide and baiting Rock\nSlides to make it easier for other Marowak checks to switch in.</p>\n<p>In general, the best way to neutralize Marowak is to simply attack it.\nFor example, the 46%-54% Snorlax takes from Earthquake isn't necessarily\npermanent, but the 41%-48% Snorlax does to Marowak is forever due to the\nlack of Leftovers and defensive aptitude. Zapdos can recover off the\nheavy damage it takes from Rock Slide, whereas the Hidden Power damage\nMarowak takes is permanent. Being able to take &quot;temporary&quot; damage to get\nhits in on Marowak tends to neuter its ability to threaten your team\nsignificantly. Just make sure that you don't leave anything in on\nMarowak that actually does end up being OHKOed.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Most Blissey sets will look something like the set above. With Heal Bell\nremoving status from its entire team and Soft-Boiled providing instant\nrecovery, Blissey will serve as a nigh impenetrable special wall and\neffective team cleric. This set is all about Heal Bell and absorbing\nspecial attacks, with the last two moveslots open to a slew of options.\nWith Toxic, Blissey can poison physical attackers on the switch and will\ndo reliable damage against anything without Rest. If Blissey does manage\nto poison an opponent with Rest, they will be forced to use Rest and put\ntheir Pokemon to sleep sooner than normal. Sing has poor accuracy, but\nit can effectively knock out one of Blissey's opponents assuming that\nopponent doesn't have Sleep Talk. Sing is most effective on the switch,\nas it can often catch physical attackers off guard as they come in to\nset up on Blissey. Sing could also come in handy when facing another\nteam that also has a Heal Bell user. If you can put the opponent's\ncleric to sleep after it decides stays in to use Heal Bell, you have\njust put your opponent's cleric out of commission. This will make it\nmuch more difficult for your opponent to abuse Belly Drum Snorlax, and\ncould let you outpace your opponent's Skarmory with your own Drumlax.\nPutting your opponent's cleric to sleep could also speed up a team based\non Toxic and Spikes as well, for example.</p>\n<p>While using Light Screen on Blissey might not seem logical at face\nvalue, the boost it gives to Blissey's team should not be underrated\nconsidering how often Blissey will be switching in and out. Light Screen\nwill also better protect Blissey from Growth sweepers such as Vaporeon,\nespecially if they get a critical hit. Light Screen will also offer\namazing support for any set-up sweepers that switch in after Blissey,\nsuch as Machamp, Marowak, and Snorlax. As for attacking options, Ice\nBeam and Flamethrower are Blissey's main staples. Flamethrower will hit\nSteel-types that Toxic can not touch, including Forretress looking to\nset up Spikes. Ice Beam nabs the super effective hit on opposing\nGround-types such as Nidoking, Marowak, and Rhydon while also providing\na 10% freeze chance. Any combination of attack and support move in\naddition to Heal Bell and Soft-Boiled is viable in most situations. This\nset's main focus is centered around using Heal Bell effectively.</p>\n<p>Blissey has a very wide movepool and it has many excellent additional\noptions beyond what are listed in the set comments above. Thunderbolt is\nan option over Ice Beam and Flamethrower if you wish to prevent Cloyster\nfrom setting up Spikes willy nilly. Growl might seem like a rather\ngimmicky option on Blissey, but it can be usable if Blissey manages to\nhit a physical attacker on the switch. Curse users will have a slightly\nharder time setting up on Blissey if it uses Growl, but STAB physical\nattacks will still do heavy damage even after the Attack drop. Growl\nalso has really high PP, which will allow it to stall out special\nattackers, thereby forcing these opponents to switch. However, keep in\nmind that Vaporeon and its brethren will be nearly impossible to stall\nout with Blissey unless it has both Light Screen and Growl, due to\nGrowth's incredibly high 63 PP.</p>\n<p>Blissey is a defensive cleric, and as such, should be used in stall\noriented teams. While Miltank, the other common Heal Bell user, is\ngeared towards the physical side, Blissey works as a special wall\ninstead, so it requires slightly different support. Any Blissey analysis\nwould be remiss to not mention Skarmory. &quot;SkarmBliss&quot; continues to be a\nfearsome combo, providing excellent synergy and stopping power against a\nwide range of threats. However, this combo still has issues with mixed\nattackers and some Curse users, such as Fire Blast Snorlax, Nidoking,\nTyranitar, and Steelix, as well as with other threats such as Gengar and\nExeggutor. Therefore, more support is required. Suicune, Raikou, and\nZapdos can all work as mixed walls and can also use a Sleep Talk set to\nwork as status absorbers. Suicune works as a great answer to Tyranitar,\nSteelix, Nidoking, and Dragonite and further helps with dealing with\nMachamp and especially Marowak. RestTalk Suicune is also a good answer\nto Exeggutor. Raikou's main selling points to compliment &quot;SkarmBliss&quot;\ndefensively are Gengar, Vaporeon, Exeggutor (if you are using Hidden\nPower Ice or Crunch, preferably with Sleep Talk as well) and Dragonite,\nbut still shares Ground-type issues. A RestTalk Zapdos, meanwhile,\noffers decent defense against Exeggutor, Vaporeon, Machamp, and\nNidoking. Both Raikou and Suicune can work especially well as phazers\ntoo. Raikou with Roar will offer defense against Thunder Misdreavus and\nJolteon while Roar Suicune will neutralize Growth Vaporeon. These two\nalso enjoy Heal Bell support from Blissey. To cover the Snorlax sets\nSkarmory has problems with, a Rock- or Ghost-type is the best idea. Both\nTyranitar and Rhydon work well as long as they carry a phazing move, and\nMisdreavus with a Perish trap set is a great option too.</p>\n<p>Of course, Blissey will need proper offensive teammates able to put\npressure on your opponents. Having a Pokemon able to set up Spikes is\nespecially important for slow stall battles. Forretress makes a great\npartner, considering it is the best Spikes user when it comes to keeping\nSpikes on the field in the long run. Cloyster, the other common Spikes\nuser, can also work as a semi-good answer to Ground-types, especially\nSteelix if your set contains Rest. It's also a better spinner than\nForretress thanks to its ability to hit Ghost-types for neutral damage.\nHowever, Cloyster will have a very hard time keeping Spikes down against\nStarmie. Speaking of Spikes, Starmie should also be taken into account\nas it is the best spinner in OU; removing Spikes from your field could\neasily be as important as laying them in the long run. Starmie also\noffers great defense against Machamp, which other physical or mixed\nwalls often struggle against. Light Screen Blissey makes a great partner\nfor set-up sweepers such as Machamp and Marowak that are often countered\nby specially based walls. Suicune, Starmie, and Hidden Power Zapdos will\nhave a much harder time taking them on behind a screen, to the point\nthat your opponent might be forced to just phaze them instead,\nconsequently taking a big hit in return. Other set-up sweepers that\nbenefit from Light Screen are Belly Drum sweepers. With Heal Bell\nsupport, Snorlax can set up Belly Drum multiple times in a single match\nby recovering its health with Rest once it finishes sweeping. This\nstrategy is known as &quot;Turbo-boosting&quot; in some circles. In addition,\nbehind Light Screen, Snorlax has no problem setting up against Thunder\ncarrying Electric-types, and Charizard survives most STAB Thunderbolts\nand Surfs even after halving his health.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Blissey is without a doubt the direct descendant of alien monsters from\nlow budget 1950s sci-fi horror films. The evidence: A.) Blissey is a\ngigantic pink blob, B.) it is impervious to most assaults, and C.) it\nhas an easily exploitable weakness waiting to be taken advantage of by\nour handsome and dashing really bad actor protagonist. Blissey's strong\npoints are its ridiculously high base 255 HP, superb 135 Special\nDefense, and access to the ever useful Heal Bell and instant recovery in\nSoft-Boiled. This combination of base stats and movepool allow it to\nabsorb every unboosted special attack in the game with ease. The bad\nnews is that Blissey has a massive weakness to physical attacks courtesy\nof its stunningly awful base 10 Defense. Even base 255 HP won't save\nBlissey from taking incredible amounts of damage from most physical\nattacks. If that wasn't enough, Blissey's middling Special Attack\nprevents it from doing significant damage to opponents, even with its\nlarge special movepool. On top of that, Blissey's best move, Heal Bell,\nwon't work in conjunction with certain other moves, narrowing down the\navailable options for it to abuse. The main difference between the other\nmain Heal Bell user, Miltank, and Blissey comes down to stat\ndistribution and defensive orientation. Miltank is oriented toward\nphysical defense and has access to STAB Body Slam, decent Attack,\nexcellent Speed, and the ability to take on Curse users. Miltank also\ntakes on mixed attackers much better than Blissey. Blissey is slower, is\nspecially oriented on offense, and takes virtually nothing form special\nattacks while providing excellent screen support and the ability to\ninduce sleep. Blissey truly is an excellent special wall and cleric, but\nit needs a team surrounding it to adequately make use of the support it\noffers.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Blissey has quite a large movepool, but unfortunately it isn't able to\nuse it to its full effectiveness because of its low Special Attack and\nthe compatibility issues with Heal Bell. The following moves are decent\noptions that Blissey cannot run alongside Heal Bell due to move\nrestrictions. This restriction unfortunately limits the usability of\nthese moves, but they are still worth mentioning. Unlike Light Screen,\nwhich is almost only intended to help Blissey's teammates, Reflect would\nalso be perfect for Blissey, boosting its pitiful Defense to more\nmanageable levels. Reflect is particularly useful for weakening common\nPokemon that like switching into Blissey, such as Snorlax and Machamp,\nmaking them much easier to handle for the proper counter. However,\nbecause Blissey is so focused on providing clerical support, giving up\nHeal Bell for the Defense boost is a rare sight. Blissey can surprise\nphysically oriented attackers with Counter, gaining a free KO if it\nplays it right. Blissey will often survive most physical attacks at full\nhealth, making Counter a usable option if it can maintain the element of\nsurprise until the right time comes to use it. With Counter, Blissey can\nmake life very awkward for Tyranitar, Nidoking, and mixed Snorlax, for\nexample, by removing their ability to fire off STAB attacks with\nimpunity. Blissey can use Thunder Wave over Toxic if it wants to neuter\nopponents with paralysis rather than wear them down with Toxic. Blissey\ncan also use Seismic Toss for constant damage output, but giving up Heal\nBell for it usually isn't worth the lack of cleric support.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Blissey is incredibly weak to nearly all physical attackers, and is\nespecially weak to those with access to boosting moves. Blissey must be\nvery wary of being used as setup bait. Its low Special Attack and\nsusceptibility will make it incredible vulnerable to powerful physical\nsweepers such as Snorlax. Snorlax can use Blissey as an opportunity to\ngrab a free Curse or Belly Drum boost and then go to town on the\nswitch-in. Snorlax can also carry Rest to sleep off any status it could\nreceive from the pink blob. Machamp is another huge thorn in Blissey's\nside. It has excellent Attack, a boosting move in Curse, and Cross Chop.\nSwords Dance Marowak is another high profile threat because it can grab\na free boost as Blissey switches out to avoid its STAB Earthquake.\nBlissey must also exercise caution against special attackers that carry\nphysically based moves such as Explosion. Gengar for example has access\nto both Explosion and Dynamic Punch which will do major damage to\nBlissey. Blissey's lack of offensive prowess make it an easy target for\nSpikes users. Cloyster and Forretress can easily switch in on Blissey\nand then go to town. Jolteon can use Blissey to easily set up an Agility\nand then Baton Pass it to a waiting sweeper such as Marowak or Snorlax.\nBlissey also won't enjoy being put to sleep or being frozen, as it\ncannot remove these status conditions with Heal Bell. Blissey would\nstill be able to pretty much wall every special attacker, as it can\nsurvive their hits until sleep wears off and use Soft-Boiled in the turn\nit wakes up, though. Nonetheless, your team won't have access to Heal\nBell support meanwhile, and a sleeping Blissey will be even more of a\nbait for physical, mixed, or set-up sweepers.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set is Misdreavus's bread and butter, and the reason that it's used\nin OU--Perish Trapping is simple and yet dastardly effective. With\nPerish Song and Mean Look Misdreavus can trap and KO many of GSC's top\nwalls, such as Miltank, Forretress, Skarmory, and Blissey. Using\nMisdreavus is simple: come in on a wall or sleeping Pokemon with low\ndamage output, trap it with Mean Look, then use Perish Song. Protect for\ntwo turns, and then switch out while the opponent is KOed. In fact,\nMisdreavus can rinse and repeat this strategy until the opponent's\ndefensive core is thoroughly broken.</p>\n<p>The first three moves are all fairly standard, while the last moveslot\nlets Misdreavus deal with phazers that can prevent it from Perish\nTrapping. Thunder is great for nailing Skarmory and Suicune, but leaves\nMisdreavus helpless against Steelix and Rhydon. Attract and Confuse Ray\nare also viable options, as they can prevent the trapped opponent from\nphazing or attacking. The difference between the two is that Confuse Ray\nhits all opponents regardless of gender, but Attract lasts indefinitely.\nIf using Attract in simulator play, it is usually a good idea to change\nMisdreavus's gender to whichever one the simulator doesn't auto-select\nin order to maximize Attract's effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Hypnosis is another effective option to stop opponents dead in their\ntracks while Perish Song is in effect. However, it should be noted that\nin almost all GSC venues, the combination of Perish Song, Mean Look, and\na sleep-inducing move is banned for competitive reasons. That being\nsaid, Misdreavus still enjoys switching in on Pokemon that have been put\nto sleep, or have just used Rest. Unless the sleeping Pokemon switches\nor uses Sleep Talk, Misdreavus will be free to uses Mean Look and Perish\nSong without fear of taking damage. Paralysis support in particular can\nbe very useful as it will stop the opponent from moving 25% of the time;\nit will also become even more effective alongside Confuse Ray. However,\nparalysis support can be difficult to pull off as many Pokemon carry\nRest, and Heal Bell support is common as well. Nonetheless, Rest users\nwill be more susceptible to Misdreavus's Perish Trap strategy because\nthey won't be able to attack without Sleep Talk.</p>\n<p>Misdreavus must be wary of trapping Pokemon that have boosting moves,\nsuch as Swords Dance or Curse, because if the opposing Pokemon boosts\nand Misdreavus switches on the last count of Perish Song, the incoming\nPokemon will almost always be heavily damaged. Again, Swords Dance\nMarowak is especially dangerous in this regard. Pokemon with Explosion\ncan execute a similar strategy, waiting until the last turn of the\nPerish count to do massive damage: you will normally have to either\nleave Misdreavus in to die from the Perish count or switch it out and\nsacrifice another Pokemon to Explosion. Pairing Misdreavus with a Rock-\nor Steel-type, such as Tyranitar or Skarmory, can help negate the damage\nfrom Explosion, but be warned that any switch-in not named Gengar will\ntake heavy damage regardless of its typing.</p>\n<p>Misdreavus is also a counter to Snorlax lacking Earthquake; this ability\nto stop many Snorlax sets cold is a great asset to any team that chooses\nto use Misdreavus. Additionally, Misdreavus's Ghost typing allows it to\nblock Rapid Spin, making it an outstanding choice for teams that utilize\nSpikes. Both Cloyster and Forretress make excellent partners as they\nboth have high Defense and can spread around Spikes for Misdreavus to\ntake advantage of.</p>\n<p>In addition, Misdreavus fits well on teams that utilize sweepers that\nenjoy the removal of opposing walls. Pokemon such as Heracross, Machamp,\nAlakazam, Snorlax, Raikou, and Vaporeon all enjoy seeing walls such as\nBlissey and Skarmory gone, depending on their sets. Finally, Misdreavus\npairs well with Growth Vaporeon, Machamp, Marowak, and Nidoking, all of\nwhom can counter the common phazers: Tyranitar and Steelix.</p>\n"

Pain Split provides a great\nway to take advantage of Misdreavus's low HP stat, and also buys some\nneeded recovery while Perish Trapping. Destiny Bond is an interesting\noption for nailing powerful tanks and sweepers that try to KO\nMisdreavus, and is notable for its ability to counter Snorlax after a\nBelly Drum or several Curse boosts. Just be wary of using Destiny Bond\nagainst the occasional faster threat that can KO Misdreavus before it\ngets a chance to use it. Destiny Bond will also leave Misdreavus\nhelpless against phazers, so unless your team can handle them\neffectively, Thunder or Confuse Ray will usually be better options for\nMisdreavus.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Misdreavus may be a potent stallbreaker, but it does have problems\nagainst Pursuit users and phazers. Tyranitar is definitely public enemy\nnumber one, as it has access to both Pursuit and Roar, as well as the\ndefenses to shrug off anything Misdreavus can throw at it. Houndoom is\nanother Dark-type that can nail Misdreavus with Pursuit as it switches\nout of an expected Crunch; it outspeeds Misdreavus as well.</p>\n<p>Depending on what move Misdreavus elects to run in the fourth slot, it\nwill have problems with certain phazers. If using Thunder, Misdreavus\nwill struggle against Rhydon, Raikou, and Steelix. Additionally, Thunder\nonly 3HKOes a healthy Suicune, giving it a chance to switch in and phaze\nMisdreavus if need be. If using Confuse Ray, Misdreavus will not be able\nto do appreciable damage to any phazer, and will be left out to dry if\nconfusion does not take effect while the opponent uses either Roar or\nWhirlwind.</p>\n<p>Misdreavus is not a naturally defensive Pokemon, and it will struggle to\ntrap and kill any Pokemon that can 2HKO it. For example, Marowak will do\na minimum of 79% damage with Earthquake, and unboosted Rhydon will\nconsistently do around 55%, which will almost always be a 2HKO unless\nMisdreavus can use Pain Split. Belly Drum Snorlax is also notable for\nits ability to KO Misdreavus with Earthquake after a Belly Drum.\nHowever, countering does have its risks, as Misdreavus can try and\nProtect twice after Perish Song, giving the opponent only a 50% chance\nof KOing.</p>\n<p>On a final note, Misdreavus detests Spikes and status. With its low HP\nand susceptibility to powerful physical attacks, Misdreavus wants all\nthe health it can get. Outside of Leftovers and Pain Split, Misdreavus\nhas no real options to restore its rather meager health. As such,\nsetting up Spikes will go a long way in preventing it from working\neffectively. A poisoned or sleeping Misdreavus can also find itself up a\ncreek without a paddle if it tries switching in on the wrong move.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>You can thank Raikou, Zapdos, and the fairly recent (circa 2009)\nunbanning of Hidden Power on these Pokemon for Quagsire's emergence as a\nlegitimate threat in GSC OU. The most common Hidden Power types used by\nZapdos and Raikou are Ice and Water; Quagsire is neutral to both, which\ngives it the edge relative to other Ground-types that might be used to\ncheck Electric-types. It should be noted that Hidden Power Grass, while\nhypothetically possible, is rare and leaves the legendary Electric-type\nPokemon vulnerable to Nidoking switch-ins.</p>\n<p>Quagsire walls these Electric-types impeccably, but it also serves as a\nfantastic mixed wall for threats such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and\nNidoking. Quagsire is also a solid check to Tentacruel, and at decently\nhigh health, it can survive a 999 Attack Charizard Earthquake and KO\nback with Hidden Power Rock. Because of its important defensive\ncapabilities, Rest is recommended on Quagsire so it can keep switching\nin to wall what it can.</p>\n<p>However, while Quagsire's walling capabilities are certainly handy,\ndecent mixed walls such as Raikou, Suicune, and Miltank are a dime a\ndozen. What truly makes Quagsire stand out is its access to Belly Drum.\nWith Belly Drum, Quagsire can threaten to sweep the opposing team,\nsomething the aforementioned mixed walls cannot boast. Furthermore, it's\ncapable of setting up Belly Drum safely in the face of the ever-present\nHidden Power Zapdos and Raikou, something even the mighty Snorlax cannot\naccomplish. STAB Earthquake is the main move Quagsire will be using\nafter setting up. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Rock hurts the Flying-types\nthat are immune to Earthquake. After a turn of setup, Hidden Power Rock\ncan OHKO Zapdos and 3HKO Skarmory, one of Quagsire's most prominent\nchecks. It should be noted that unlike other offensive sweepers such as\nSnorlax and Marowak, Quagsire isn't capable of threatening much of\nanything without a turn of setup.</p>\n<p>Quagsire likes support to help it wear down its most prominent checks.\nTyranitar with Pursuit is one of the best teammates, as it can be used\nto snipe Exeggutor, which is otherwise a hard counter for Quagsire.\nSeismic Toss Heracross and Belly Drum Snorlax are other solid teammates\nthat lure in Skarmory, arguably Quagsire's number one check, and hit it\nfor heavy damage.</p>\n<p>Quagsire's biggest issues as an offensive contributor are its very low\nSpeed and inability to instantly threaten switch-ins the way Marowak\ncan. For this reason, a lot of general support is essential for Quagsire\nto ever get an opportunity to sweep. In particular, support from Stun\nSpore Exeggutor and Body Slam Snorlax helps to target key walls such as\nSkarmory and Suicune with paralysis and to give Quagsire general\nparalysis support against &quot;random&quot; Pokemon such as Miltank and Starmie\nthat can otherwise stop a sweep with a little luck. Spikes support is\nalso handy for forcing Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Suicune to Explode\nor Rest, thereby giving Quagsire an opening to set up Belly Drum.</p>\n<p>Rapid Spin is essential, too; having to switch into Spikes really limits\nQuagsire's ability to set up Belly Drum, and unless the field is clear\nof Spikes, Quagsire can't go for the kill against Water-types that use\nSTAB Surf to put Quagsire at extremely low health after using Belly\nDrum. Furthermore, Quagsire appreciates Heal Bell support from the likes\nof Miltank just as the most popular Belly Drum sweeper, Snorlax, does.\nWith Heal Bell support, Quagsire can Rest off any residual damage, then\nhave its sleep turns negated to allow it to switch immediately back in\nto threaten another Belly Drum sweep.</p>\n<p>Quagsire is a fantastic teammate for teams that need its defensive\ntalents, too. A team without Raikou definitely appreciates Quagsire's\nability to hard-counter Electric-types that lack the rare Hidden Power\nGrass; Snorlax may be on every team, but Snorlax alone can't take STAB\nThunders from Zapdos and Raikou all day. In addition, Quagsire is also\nan extremely potent mixed wall that counters key offensive threats such\nas Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite. Unlike mixed walls such as\nMiltank and Suicune, Quagsire does not have an exploitable weakness to a\nmove type commonly used by the most prominent mixed attackers in GSC.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Quagsire has always been a competent defensive Ground-type. However,\nit's generally not thought of as a top OU Pokemon because its ability to\ncounter Hidden Power legends was not needed when they were banned and\nbecause it's a lot less offensive than other Ground-types. However, in\nthe modern metagame where the legendary Electric-types regularly carry\nHidden Power, Quagsire's neutralities to Ice- and Water-type attacks\ngive it a unique defensive advantage over other Ground-types, although\nthe uncommon Hidden Power Grass can still be used to ruin it. Quagsire\nis a decent mixed wall that can threaten to sweep if given the chance to\nset up a Belly Drum, but unlike other Ground-types such as Nidoking and\nMarowak, it doesn't have the attacking stats to pose an immediate\noffensive threat.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A more defensive variant of Quagsire could be built by replacing Belly\nDrum with Curse. This would allow Quagsire to force out mixed attackers\nand force the opponent to send walls rather than offensive threats into\nQuagsire without having to rely on the difficult-to-use Belly Drum. This\nis important because a Quagsire hovering around half health can't\nthreaten to set up Belly Drum, allowing a threat such as mixed Snorlax\nto switch in and take the initiative; on the other hand, Curse Quagsire\nwould be able to easily deter this switch-in. A more defensive Quagsire\ncould also use Haze in Belly Drum's slot. This would prevent Baton Pass\nusers, most notably Jolteon, from transferring their boosts to another\nPokemon while also neutralizing Curse users and stopping Belly Drum\nSnorlax sweeps. When using Curse or Haze, Sleep Talk can be used over\nHidden Power Rock. Hidden Power Rock's main use is allowing Quagsire to\nKO Zapdos and Skarmory after a Belly Drum, so without Belly Drum, that\nslot would be better suited toward a more defensive move. Note that if\nBelly Drum is dropped, even for Curse, Quagsire is not going to\ncontribute much of anything offensively because too many Pokemon shut it\ndown entirely.</p>\n<p>In addition to more defensive sets, Quagsire could forgo Rest and run an\nall-out offensive Belly Drum set. Generally, Sludge Bomb is selected in\nplace of Rest to give Quagsire a powerful move to use against Exeggutor.\nEven before a Belly Drum, it does quite a bit of damage to Exeggutor and\nthreatens to poison it. Generally, an all-out offensive Quagsire will be\nused alongside Pokemon such as Jolteon and Smeargle that can pass\nAgility boosts, thereby negating Quagsire's lackluster Speed and\nallowing it to set up a sweep legitimately.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is using Quagsire's special attacking movepool. Surf\nis generally a poor move choice, but it can help check Rhydon more\neffectively and instantly threaten solid damage against Skarmory (30% -\n35%). Note, however, that Surf still fails to 3HKO Skarmory. Ice Beam is\nanother option; it's a decent attack for instant damage against\nExeggutor switch-ins, and might also be useful for attempting to freeze\na key Quagsire check such as Skarmory or Suicune. Generally, though,\nQuagsire shouldn't be using even STAB special attacks because its\nSpecial Attack is very poor.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Skarmory is the chief Quagsire check, safely avoiding a 3HKO even from\nQuagsire's STAB Surf and comfortably phazing Quagsire after it has used\nBelly Drum (999 Attack Hidden Power Rock does 40% - 47% to Skarmory).\nAny other attack does pitiful, insignificant damage to Skarmory.\nExeggutor is another potent check; although it fears Sludge Bomb, it\nswitches in on Earthquake and Hidden Power Rock with impunity and\nthreatens to KO with Giga Drain or Psychic. Meganium stops Quagsire even\ncolder than Exeggutor does; it has better defenses, an instant recovery\nmove in Synthesis, and unlike Exeggutor, isn't picked off by Pursuit\nTyranitar. However, Synthesis's mere 8 PP erodes quickly, and Meganium\nis no fonder of taking a possible Sludge Bomb poison than Exeggutor is.\nHeracross is a potent Quagsire check, too. It resists Earthquake and is\nneutral to Hidden Power Rock; furthermore, it boasts a powerful Megahorn\nthat threatens to 3HKO Quagsire. Thus, the presence of a\nmedium-to-high-health Heracross effectively prevents Quagsire from using\nBelly Drum safely. Suicune is another strong Quagsire check, though it\nneeds to be at high health and avoid paralysis if it is going to perform\nthis function competently. Its Surf 3HKOes Quagsire, and if it switches\nin at full health as Quagsire uses Belly Drum, it KOes Quagsire with\nSurf before Quagsire can KO it with Earthquake. Cloyster is a decent\ncheck; while it can't 3HKO with STAB Surf or Ice Beam, Cloyster has the\nDefense to survive a 999 Attack Earthquake and hits hard enough with its\nSTAB moves to 2HKO Quagsire after it uses Belly Drum. Marowak can serve\nas a check if you predict Belly Drum. Quagsire is one of the few Pokemon\nMarowak outspeeds, and a Thick Club-boosted Earthquake does a minimum of\n53% to Quagsire. Thus, Marowak can threaten to KO Quagsire if it sets up\nBelly Drum on the switch-in. However, Marowak is an unreliable check, as\nswitching it in on an Earthquake can render it unable to survive a hit\nsuch as Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos later in the match.</p>\n<p>If you can reliably keep Spikes down, you can use anything with a strong\nSTAB Surf, such as Starmie or Vaporeon, to effectively trade with\nQuagsire. Although these Pokemon fail to OHKO Quagsire after a Belly\nDrum and are OHKOed by a 999 Attack STAB Earthquake, they can lower\nQuagsire's health to dangerous levels if it decides to go for the KO,\nthereby leaving it unable to switch back in easily. This, in turn, can\nopen up your own Zapdos or Raikou for an offensive push. However,\nwithout Spikes, it becomes much more difficult to handle a possible\nQuagsire switch-in, so in the event that you cannot keep Spikes down,\nyou should only use these frailer Water-types as Quagsire counters if it\nhas enough residual damage to be put in KO range after a Belly Drum. Of\ncourse, anything with a Grass-type attack that isn't weak to Earthquake\nmakes a solid Quagsire counter; even with a Ground-type weakness, having\na Grass-type move can catch Quagsire by surprise and ruin it for the\nrest of the match. However, Grass-type moves are generally not very\nuseful outside of countering Quagsire, so other means of checking\nQuagsire are preferred.</p>\n",

Dynamic Punch, though\ninaccurate, will dissuade switch-ins like Tyranitar and Miltank with its\npossibility of causing ridiculous damage, and Body Slam is a good\nall-around attack; though not extremely powerful, if you score\nparalysis, life will be hectic for Raikou, Miltank, and other Pokemon\nthat can take a wide variety of attacks well.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, there are other options for this set that can be switched\nalmost at will. Among these move options are Double-Edge, Fire Blast,\nHidden Power Ground, Wing Attack, Surf, Hydro Pump, and Extreme Speed.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Vaporeon is a unique offensive Pokemon in GSC OU. It's a legitimate\nspecial threat that can take a hit and can set up with Growth. Unlike\nthe legendary Electric-types that are GSC's other prominent special\nthreats, Vaporeon is more geared towards setting up and sweeping rather\nthan scoring opportunistic KOs. Vaporeon sets up on the special side,\nwhich makes it immune to stall tactics such as Growl and Charm, as\nopposed to other reliable setup Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax.\nDissimilar to more daring setup Pokemon such as Belly Drum Snorlax and\nSwords Dance Marowak, Vaporeon is able to break stall while having an\neasy-to-use setup move and the ability to take hits.</p>\n<p>Vaporeon's STAB is the choice between reliability and power. Hydro Pump\nis great for wallbreaking. It can 3HKO Snorlax after a single Growth and\nit also does 36-43% to Raikou without a boost, meaning that if Spikes\nare down and Vaporeon's Hydro Pump connects, Raikou can only afford to\nswitch in once more before having to use Rest. Surf, on the other hand,\nisn't going to miss and doesn't suffer from Hydro Pump's horrendous 8\nPP. Growth is the whole point of the set, allowing Vaporeon to take\nadvantage of its good defenses and set up the sweep. Rest keeps it alive\nand gives it the longevity that allows it to play defensively and to set\nup when needed. As for the fourth move, Sleep Talk is the standard and\nkeeps Vaporeon around to tank hits from Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon.\nFurthermore, Sleep Talk also minimizes downtime when trying to set up.\nAcid Armor, however, beats CurseLax in a head-to-head match-up. Acid\nArmor is also nice for PP wars with its incredible 61 PP, and buffers\nVaporeon against other dangerous physical attackers such as Heracross,\nMachamp, and Explosion users.</p>\n<p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Umbreon get rid of Exeggutor, a\nprominent Pokemon with a resistance to Water-type attacks that also has\nthe offensive prowess to force Vaporeon to switch out. Tyranitar in\nparticular can also chip away at Zapdos and Raikou, which force Vaporeon\nout with strong STAB Electric-type moves, but can be rendered unable to\nswitch in on Vaporeon with some residual damage. Other great partners\nfor Vaporeon are offensive Explosion users; Exeggutor and Steelix\nfrequently target Zapdos with their Explosions, Gengar commonly takes\ndown Raikou, Steelix and Self-Destruct Snorlax can KO Roar Suicune, and\nCloyster has a good chance of taking out any of these threats.\nParalyzing Raikou and weakening Snorlax can also go a long way towards\nhelping Vaporeon pick up the pieces. Thunder or Thunder Wave from Zapdos\nor even your own Raikou can paralyze an opposing Raikou, while the\ncombination of Toxic and Spikes will eventually force Snorlax to Rest,\ngiving Vaporeon an opening to set up against it.</p>\n<p>When using Vaporeon, it's vital to use prediction to beat its checks.\nWhen you predict an Electric-type switch-in, use Vaporeon's STAB move;\neven without a boost, Vaporeon's STAB does a lot to Zapdos and Raikou,\nespecially if Vaporeon is using Hydro Pump. When you expect Snorlax, use\nGrowth. Vaporeon isn't scaring Snorlax with an unboosted STAB move, but\nSnorlax isn't instantly forcing Vaporeon out either, especially not Acid\nArmor variants, so having the Special Attack boost can put a Snorlax\nswitch-in in a pretty awkward position, particularly if Vaporeon is\ntouting Hydro Pump's potential 3HKO. If some other wall such as Roar\nSuicune or a high-health Exeggutor is going to switch in, Vaporeon\nshould duck out and give the opportunity to another Pokemon to do its\ndamage. Suicune is a fine double-switch opportunity for Roar Raikou to\nstart Spikes shuffling or Cloyster to set up its Spikes, whereas\nExeggutor is put in a bind if you predict and double-switch to a Pursuit\nuser such as Tyranitar. If the opponent has none of these available,\nVaporeon is free to sweep, so just set up Growths and finish the job.\nThis includes situations where the opponent is using Blissey to try to\nwall Vaporeon, as Blissey cannot stop Vaporeon from setting up to the\npoint where a single critical hit can destroy it, never mind the fact\nthat Vaporeon wins most stall wars against Blissey by virtue of Growth's\ntitanic PP count.</p>\n<p>Vaporeon can use other moves effectively in the last moveslot. Thanks to\nGSC's phazing mechanics, Vaporeon's slower Roar prevents Roar Suicune\nfrom phazing it. Roar also allows Vaporeon to win mirror matches and can\nalso be used to Spikes-shuffle with Vaporeon's ability to force\nswitches. Ice Beam is an excellent coverage option for destroying\nExeggutor, Dragonite, and Zapdos. The ability to freeze foes such as\nSuicune and Blissey can also facilitate a sweep. However, Sleep Talk or\nAcid Armor is generally the way to go.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Vaporeon was a mediocre defensive Pokemon outclassed by Suicune for the\nmajority of GSC's history. Its draws over Suicune were access to Reflect\nand Haze, but ultimately not having that monstrous Defense stat left it\nunused in OU. Then, the NYPC gods gave Vaporeon and its Eeveelution\nbrethren a gift from Pokemon heaven--Growth--which catapulted Vaporeon\ninto legitimate OU territory. Growth is the only move in GSC that boosts\nthe Special Attack stat, and Vaporeon is by far the best user for a\nstandalone special sweep thanks to its bulk and high Special Attack.\nNowadays, while Vaporeon still has the same defensive prowess, Growth\nboosts its Special Attack, which is high even without a boost but often\noverlooked, and makes it one of the premier offensive threats in the\ngame. Vaporeon is a threat that must not be underestimated despite its\ninitial lack of popularity.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>As for options in the fourth moveslot of the main set, Vaporeon has a\ncouple of okay options other than the ones listed. Hidden Power Electric\n3HKOes Suicune as well as other Vaporeon at +1 and also wrecks the odd\nTentacruel looking for a free boost. Blizzard is also an option as it\ncan 2HKO Zapdos without a boost and OHKOes Exeggutor about 50% of the\ntime at +1 after factoring accuracy. However, Blizzard's low PP and\naccuracy are major turnoffs.</p>\n<p>A Baton Pass set could work. In this case, Vaporeon is best off forgoing\nRest for Acid Armor as a second stat boost to pass. Good recipients\ninclude Zapdos, Raikou, and Exeggutor. Growth boosts the recipient's\nSpecial Attack to scary levels, while Acid Armor boosts Defense to\nrender the normally threatening Snorlax unable to do meaningful damage\nin return. Vaporeon is a great user of Baton Pass because, aside from\nRoar Suicune, no other popular phazer is capable of stopping Vaporeon\nfrom passing its boosts without taking a lot of damage from a boosted\nHydro Pump or Surf. Even then, Suicune can be beaten by using Roar on\nBaton Pass Vaporeon. However, Raikou will usually make life difficult\nfor a Baton Pass set. While it can't comfortably use Roar against\nVaporeon without taking a lot of damage in return, it will do tons of\ndamage to Vaporeon if it decides to stay in against Raikou, and it can\ntank most special attacking Baton Pass targets, even at +1. Zapdos is\nalso a tough foe for Baton Pass Vaporeon; it cannot tank +1 special\nattackers the way Raikou can, but it does heavy damage to Vaporeon if it\ndecides to stay in to use its slower Baton Pass, thereby preventing\nVaporeon from trying again later in the match.</p>\n<p>The classic pre-Growth defensive Vaporeon set of Rest, Surf, Haze, and\nReflect is an option for those who want a Suicune with worse defenses\nbut better support moves. However, Vaporeon is better off using Growth\nto play offensively than trying to be a Suicune, especially since it was\nBL before the advent of Growth.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Most of Vaporeon's common checks don't wall it completely, but rather\nthreaten to smash its face in. Zapdos and Raikou are the most common\nchecks and can 2HKO with their STABs. However, they can't take too many\nSurfs or Hydro Pumps on the switch. Snorlax is the second most common\nanswer to Vaporeon, but it's a shaky check. Snorlax is 3HKOed by a +1\nHydro Pump and Acid Armor variants of Vaporeon beat it without relying\non a move with iffy accuracy. Exeggutor is a good stop-gap against\nVaporeon but won't last forever. It's easily targeted by Pursuit, dies\nquickly to Ice Beam Vaporeon, and if Spikes are down it will eventually\nbe put into +1 Surf or Hydro Pump KO range. Cloyster can outspeed\nVaporeon and Explode on it, but Cloyster isn't doing anything to stop\nVaporeon without sacrificing itself with Explosion. Gengar 3HKOes with\nan Electric-type attack, and can Explode or use Destiny Bond if things\ngo south, although it struggles to take Vaporeon's attacks. As for less\ncommon checks, Tentacruel resists Surf and sets up a counter-sweep with\nSwords Dance. Dragonite resists Surf and threatens Vaporeon with Thunder\nand Double-Edge, but loses to Ice Beam variants. Heracross outspeeds\nVaporeon and very narrowly misses out on 2HKOing it at full health,\nalthough Acid Armor mitigates this damage and Heracross has trouble\nswitching into Vaporeon.</p>\n<p>While Vaporeon is usually countered by using high damage output, there\nare quite a few Pokemon that wall it entirely. Roar Suicune is the most\ncommon full stop to Vaporeon, although it fails to stop last-Pokemon\nVaporeon or variants that use Roar themselves. Suicune can also play to\nfreeze Vaporeon with both Ice Beam and Mirror Coat, with Mirror Coat\nkeeping Vaporeon wary of attacking while Suicune tries to freeze it.\nAside from Suicune, Light Screen Blissey can help teammates such as\nZapdos to switch more easily into Vaporeon. It can also try to outstall\nVaporeon, but Blissey will usually lose the PP war and, on turns when\nLight Screen wears off, a combination of a high damage roll and a\ncritical hit from a +5 Surf will put Blissey in KO range on the\nfollowing turn. Vaporeon can also use Ice Beam to freeze Blissey. At the\nvery least, Light Screen Blissey will be difficult to defeat for Hydro\nPump Vaporeon and its meager 8 PP. Starmie resists Surf and can use\nThunder hoping for three consecutive hits to 3HKO Vaporeon or Light\nScreen to flat-out stall Vaporeon out of PP. Starmie, unlike Blissey,\ncan outstall Vaporeon because of Rapid Spin's high PP. As for less\ncommon walls to Vaporeon, Meganium can wall Vaporeon with Leech Seed,\nSynthesis, and possibly Light Screen, although Ice Beam Vaporeon can\nbeat it. In addition, Kingdra can Curse in Vaporeon's face, uses Haze,\nor even go for the freeze with Ice Beam while only being 5HKOed by +5\nSurfs, although it can be 2HKOed by +5 Ice Beams or stalled out by Acid\nArmor variants.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Vaporeon is a good check to itself. Even after switching in\nto give the opposing Vaporeon a turn advantage, a Sleep Talking Vaporeon\nhas only slightly less than even odds at beating an opposing Sleep Talk\nVaporeon and better odds if the opposing Vaporeon is not a Sleep Talking\nvariant. +4 Surf and +3 Hydro Pump both 3HKO an opposing Vaporeon, so\nboost this far before you stop setting up and start attacking.\nAlternatively, you can just use Roar so that you can phaze opposing\nVaporeon after you gather a couple of boosts in the Growth war.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This is the standard Gengar set that maximizes its ability to threaten\nthe GSC metagame. This set hits pretty much everything hard. The\nElectric-type move is Gengar's pseudo-STAB and, running off its high\nbase 130 Special Attack, is what keeps bulky Water-types with high\nSpecial Defense, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, from switching in.\nThunderbolt is generally preferred because Gengar is too frail to afford\nto miss a lot, but Thunder is a good option for the increased paralysis\nchance, which is particularly useful against the speedier Raikou. Ice\nPunch is the next move and, aside from keeping Ground-types at bay, hits\nZapdos and Exeggutor super effectively. It can also be used for its\nfreeze chance in match-ups where the opponent cannot touch Gengar, such\nas when Gengar switches in against Miltank or Seismic Toss Heracross.\nThe next moveslot is generally reserved for Gengar's method of dealing\nwith checks other than killing itself. Hypnosis is the most generally\neffective move, being able to put any one counter out of commission.\nHowever, Hypnosis can be caught easily by a Sleep Talk user if it is\nwell-predicted, so it must be used judiciously. Furthermore, if sleep is\nused once it cannot be used again, making Hypnosis an unreliable move\nfor dealing with foes such as Pursuit Tyranitar. For this reason,\nDynamic Punch is a viable alternative, as it hits Tyranitar hard enough\nto 2HKO it. Dynamic Punch is also good for putting Snorlax and Umbreon\nswitch-ins into Explosion KO range after Spikes damage. Finally, the\nlast moveslot deals with Gengar's kamikaze tactics for taking out\nopponents. Explosion is the preferred choice as Gengar tends to draw in\nsleep absorbers and physically weak special walls and because Gengar is\nfrequently chosen specifically to KO Raikou and has no other options to\ndo that. However, if Raikou isn't a problem, you can opt instead for\nDestiny Bond, which is a more reliable way to take out opposing\nTyranitar, CurseLax, and Steelix. All of these are slower than Gengar,\ntake little damage from its BoltBeam combo, and can frequently have\nmultiple Curses under their belts, making Destiny Bond the preferred\n(and often game-saving) way to deal with them.</p>\n<p>Gengar pairs well with teammates that enjoy having its assassination\ntargets removed. Zapdos makes an excellent partner, as two of its main\ncounters, Raikou and Snorlax, are two of Gengar's more common Explosion\ntargets. If Gengar is using Destiny Bond, it can goad Tyranitar or\nSteelix into attacking and killing themselves. This can be useful for\nSnorlax, as these Normal-resisting Pokemon can frequently give it\ntrouble.</p>\n<p>Gengar is not just a role-playing assassin, but also works fantastically\nas an offensive powerhouse in its own right. It really enjoys using its\nimmunities and its speed to avoid taking as many hits as possible. While\nit can be effective as a lead, Gengar is often better used later in the\nmatch, when opposing Pokemon are weakened and likely in OHKO or 2HKO\nrange of Gengar's super effective attacks. However, if the opponent is\nusing a Normal-type without any coverage moves, such as Miltank or a\nmono-attacking Snorlax, be sure to switch Gengar in early and often to\ntake advantage of the opponent's inability to deal damage to it. If you\nplan to do this with Gengar, though, you should either be using Dynamic\nPunch or be very careful with Hypnosis to ensure you can deal with\nTyranitar, which is likely on the opponent's team because of the fact\nthat they are using a Pokemon incapable of touching Gengar. Furthermore,\nif the opponent is using a wall that Gengar is typically used\nspecifically to kill, such as Raikou, do not be afraid to pull the\ntrigger with Explosion, especially if you have been throwing out\nattacking moves the whole time. The opponent will likely be perfectly\nwilling to chance having their Sleep Talk Raikou killed when the risk of\ntrying to predict an Explosion is more damaging than the risk of more\nsuper effective attacks and a possible Hypnosis against the rest of\ntheir team. Just make sure that Raikou has taken a slight amount of\ndamage or is paralyzed when you pull the trigger, as a full-health\nRaikou can usually survive Gengar's Explosion and, since it outspeeds\neverything, easily use Rest to undo the Explosion damage without the\nfear of being revenge killed.</p>\n<p>Gengar can ditch the standard fare for the third option in favor of Mean\nLook. Using Mean Look prevents a switch-in such as Raikou from switching\nback out in an attempt to predict an Explosion, allowing Gengar to\nExplode safely. Mean Look also pairs well with Destiny Bond, as it\nprevents a mixed attacker such as Tyranitar from switching out to avoid\nknocking Gengar out when it's using Destiny Bond. Hypnosis might seem an\nintuitive move to pair with Mean Look, but sleep trapping (sleep move +\nMean Look) is sometimes outright banned and, if not, is typically looked\ndown upon. If sleep trapping is allowed, though, Gengar with Hypnosis\nand Mean Look can be an effective set. Forgoing either Ice Punch or\nThunderbolt for Nightmare or Curse can make a sleep trapping Gengar\nparticularly deadly. In addition to making room for Mean Look, the third\nmoveslot could be forgone to allow room for Gengar to use Destiny Bond\nand Explosion on the same set. This allows Gengar to be more flexible\nwith its assassination attempts. Explosion allows it to do serious\ndamage to Raikou, Zapdos, and unboosted Snorlax, whereas Destiny Bond\nallows Gengar to take down Tyranitar, Steelix, and Curse-boosted\nSnorlax.</p>\n<p>Fire Punch could be inserted somewhere on the set, usually over the\nsecond or third moveslots. It's mostly useful for Steelix, which does\nnot take super effective damage from BoltBeam, does heavy damage to\nGengar with STAB super effective Earthquakes, and ruins Gengar's\nattempts at Exploding thanks to its ludicrous Defense and Steel typing.\nFire Punch also allows Gengar to counter Curse Heracross, which\notherwise sets up with impunity against BoltBeam, and allows Gengar to\nOHKO Forretress, which can otherwise set up Spikes against Gengar\nwithout taking too much damage in return. However, Fire Punch is a poor\ncoverage option outside of these particular match-ups. Ice Punch is\nrarely foregone as it 3HKOes Zapdos and Ground-types, whereas Dynamic\nPunch or Hypnosis is preferred in the third moveslot to give Gengar a\nway to beat Tyranitar, which otherwise Pursuits it to death.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set is basically the classic Thunder Misdreavus set slapped onto\nGengar. Gengar's Poison typing generally makes it inferior for this role\nbecause this makes it take a lot more damage from Earthquake and\nPsychic, making Perish trap much more difficult to pull off. However,\nwhat Gengar has over Misdreavus is that nobody expects Perish trap from\nGengar. Seriously, nobody sees this coming. Opponents will likely stay\naway from bringing their phazer in on a potential Hypnosis when scouting\nout Gengar's set and will instead frequently bring in their Sleep Talk\nRaikou or Zapdos looking to absorb Hypnosis or will try to stall you out\nwith their non-Earthquake Snorlax only to find out that you just set up\nMean Look and plan to kill it with Perish Song. Mean Look and Perish\nSong form the eponymous Perish trap combo that kills anything that can't\nphaze Gengar the turn that immediately follows the switch-in, and\nProtect allows Gengar to survive an onslaught from a Sleep Talk using\nElectric-type while it waits out the Perish Song turns. This is\nnecessary, because otherwise Gengar is 2HKOed by Raikou and Zapdos, two\ncommon foes it is likely to bait and kill with this set. The last\nmoveslot is commandeered by Gengar's Electric-type pseudo-STAB for two\nreasons. The first is to limit the range of phazers that would be able\nto switch in against Gengar to stop its Perish trap routine. Skarmory in\nparticular is a very common phazer, as is Roar Suicune. Secondly, and\nmore importantly, having Gengar's main attacking move allows Gengar to\nbluff its standard set and catch opponents off guard. This is crucial to\nGengar's success as a Perish trapper, as without the element of\nsurprise, Gengar is outclassed as a Perish trapper by the pure\nGhost-type, Misdreavus. As usual, Thunderbolt is typically preferred for\nits accuracy given Gengar's low defenses; however, Thunder can be used\nfor the increased paralysis chance, which can be helpful when trying to\npull off Perish trap against a foe such as Roar Raikou.</p>\n<p>Above all else, it should be stressed that Gengar needs to utilize the\nelement of surprise to make this set work, lest it be outclassed by\nMisdreavus. As such, it's probably best to scout your opponent a bit by\nfirst tossing out a few Thunderbolts or switching out if you expect a\nPursuit Tyranitar switch-in. It's also a good idea to avoid using sleep\nmoves if any of your other Pokemon have them unless you think you can\nput the phazers that counter Gengar to sleep. The idea is to keep the\nopponent wary of Gengar possibly using Hypnosis to incapacitate their\nphazer. If your opponent keeps sending phazers into Gengar, it's a good\nidea to wear them down and either force them to Rest, have them\nparalyzed, or have them in Gengar's KO range before you bring it out\nagain. If your opponent brings in a Sleep Talk user or Snorlax to check\nGengar the first time you bring it out, the next time you bring Gengar\nout you can pull the trigger and try to catch these switch-ins with\nPerish trap. If all else fails, if you suspect that the opponent's\nSnorlax does not carry Earthquake, you can switch Gengar in as Snorlax\nis setting up Curses and see how the opponent reacts. If Snorlax\ncontinues to Curse up, it's likely to try to stall you out and you\nshould be safe to try to KO Snorlax with Perish trap. In general, just\nmake sure you are reasonably certain the opponent is not going to switch\na phazer into Gengar as you use Mean Look, lest you lose the surprise\nfactor for nothing.</p>\n<p>Gengar could run a couple of other attacking options in its attacking\nmoveslot to hit different threats while bluffing its standard set. Ice\nPunch is almost always seen on Gengar, and it can be useful for\npreventing switch-ins by the Ground-type Pokemon that can phaze or OHKO\nGengar. Dynamic Punch is less frequently seen on the standard Gengar,\nbut it is plausible and can hurt Tyranitar for major damage and confuse\nother phazers should you need to buy a turn to pull off Perish trap.\nFire Punch is very rarely seen on Gengar but it's still plausible on the\nmain set and can keep Steelix from switching in and stopping you cold.\nThe Electric-type move is usually preferred because it is Gengar's\nstrongest available attacking option that the standard set would be the\nleast likely to go without.</p>\n<p>Perish trap Gengar has the option of running two attacking moves. For\nexample, Gengar can forgo Protect to use Ice Punch to complete the\nBoltBeam combo. This gives Gengar the famous attacking coverage of its\nstandard set and makes it easier to bluff that set. However, without\nProtect, Gengar cannot withstand enough neutral hits from any reasonably\nstrong STAB move to KO with Perish trap. This makes it difficult to KO\nSleep Talk Raikou or Zapdos with Perish trap, although Snorlax without\nEarthquake is still easy to catch and kill.</p>\n<p>Gengar could use Confuse Ray to screw up phazers or Destiny Bond to try\nto take certain threats down with it if it's been found out. However,\nthese options either leave Gengar without a damaging move, thereby\nmaking it much more likely to be discovered, or without Protect, which\nmakes Perish trapping more difficult to pull off. One non-damaging move\nthat would seem to pair perfectly with Perish trap but is not an option\nis Hypnosis. This is because using a sleep move alongside Perish Song\nand an indefinite trapping move (Mean Look or Spider Web) is banned in\nany serious GSC match.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Gengar is an interesting Pokemon. It gets a wonderful movepool with\nsuper effective coverage and kamikaze moves that can hurt pretty much\nanything the OU tier has to offer. However, since Shadow Ball is\nphysical, Gengar gets no special STAB to run off that amazing base 130\nSpecial Attack. Gengar is also very frail, and while its Ghost typing is\nvery useful for capitalizing off foes that only run a Normal STAB for an\nattacking move, it's vulnerable to Pursuit and cannot take a hit that it\ndoesn't resist. Plus, as a Ghost-type, Misdreavus outclasses it as a\nspinblocker, Perish trapper, and Snorlax counter because of Gengar's\nunfortunate weaknesses to Earthquake and Starmie's Psychic. Furthermore,\nits Speed, while great, is eclipsed by Raikou's and Starmie's, which\nleads to particularly relevant match-up problems. In spite of these\nissues, Gengar is the tier's best assassin, being able to take down\npretty much anything it wants to with Explosion, Destiny Bond, wonderful\ntype coverage, or some sort of surprise. To get the most out of it,\nGengar users should be sure to play to its strengths, keep their\nprediction caps on, know how to utilize the element of surprise, and be\nwary of letting it take any kind of status or unresisted hit.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>While Gengar has a plethora of options available, most of its\nalternative move options have already been discussed. However, one\nundiscussed option is Counter, which can bounce back non-STAB\nEarthquakes from Snorlax or Tyranitar, or even weaker STAB Earthquakes\nfrom Steelix or Nidoking, for a KO. STAB Rock Slides from Tyranitar or\nnon-STAB Hidden Powers and Rock Slides from Machamp are also excellent\nmoves to bounce back with Counter. However, Counter is a fairly\nsituational surprise, as many Snorlax do not carry Earthquake, many\nTyranitar have the non-physical Crunch to nail Gengar, Nidoking has a\nslight chance to OHKO Gengar with Earthquake, and most of these threats\ncan always just use Curse to have enough Attack to OHKO Gengar. However,\nthat last point about Curse users could be taken advantage of by pairing\nCounter with Destiny Bond.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Gengar has no 100% counters, as it has ways to screw over any and every\npotential check. The best all-around check is Raikou, as it outspeeds\nGengar, can survive Explosion at full health, can neutralize the\nExplosion threat with Reflect, and can even use Sleep Talk to negate the\nHypnosis threat or Roar to negate the Perish trap threat. Umbreon is\nanother top check, as it does not take a lot of damage from Dynamic\nPunch, takes only 65-77% from Explosion, and can Pursuit Gengar to death\nor counter-trap a Perish trapping Gengar with a Mean Look and Baton Pass\nset. However, Umbreon can still be killed by Explosion if it's been\nweakened, can be caught by Hypnosis, and Pursuit Umbreon cannot KO\nGengar quickly enough to beat the Perish trap set. Dark-types with\nhigher Special Attack such as Tyranitar and Houndoom do a better job of\nusing Pursuit against Gengar, and Tyranitar resists Explosion while\nfrequently carrying Roar to deal with a high-health Perish trap Gengar.\nHowever, these threats, in addition to being vulnerable to Destiny Bond\nand Hypnosis, are hit hard by the potential Dynamic Punch. Steelix makes\na solid check to Gengar as well, since it doesn't take super effective\ndamage from BoltBeam, resists Explosion, and just barely misses out on\nan OHKO with Earthquake. However, Steelix can be worn down with several\nIce Punches on the switch, and of course, it is weak to the occasional\nFire Punch and can always be caught by Destiny Bond or Hypnosis. Snorlax\nalso makes a great check for Gengar, especially if it has Earthquake. It\ntakes paltry damage from Gengar's non-STAB special attacks and only\ntakes 28-33% from Dynamic Punch and 69-81% from Explosion, even less\nafter Curse. However, without Earthquake, Snorlax has to rely on trying\nto outstall Gengar, making it vulnerable to the Ice Punch freeze or even\nthe potential Perish trap KO. Even with Earthquake, Gengar can always\nsurprise Snorlax with Destiny Bond, incapacitate it with Hypnosis, or KO\na weakened Snorlax with Explosion. Quagsire makes an okay check as it\ndoes not take super effective damage from BoltBeam while hitting back\nhard with STAB Earthquake, although as with most things, it can be\nbeaten by Hypnosis, Destiny Bond, or Explosion. Blissey also sponges\nGengar's special moves like a champ, although it does nothing to force\nGengar out, takes a lot of damage from Dynamic Punch, can be killed by\nExplosion, and can be ruined as a Heal Bell supporter by Hypnosis.</p>\n<p>Aside from the above checks, there are a few other Pokemon that don't\nmatch as well with Gengar one-on-one, but can still step in to tango\nwith it if need be. Zapdos is one of these. It frequently has Sleep\nTalk, so Hypnosis isn't too big of a deal, and can hit Gengar hard and\npossibly paralyze it with STAB Thunder, although it is 3HKOed by Ice\nPunch and can always be KOed in return by Explosion or Destiny Bond. In\naddition, Ice-weak Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoking, and Marowak\ncan hit hard enough to OHKO Gengar, so if they manage to switch in as\nGengar Thunderbolts, it can be forced to switch out, ceding offensive\nmomentum to you. However, one Ice Punch on the switch effectively ruins\nthese Pokemon, and not just as Gengar counters, so do this sparingly. In\naddition to Ice-weak foes that can hit hard in return, anything that can\ntake BoltBeam reasonably well can act as a Gengar counter in some form.\nMisdreavus, your own Gengar, Heracross (barring Fire Punch), and even\nMiltank can all switch into Gengar to take its hits and force it to use\nits surprise tactics to beat you. However, keep in mind that unless you\nhave a way to force Gengar to switch out, such as Earthquake on\nHeracross or Perish trap on Misdreavus, Gengar can always stay in and\njust go for the freeze with Ice Punch.</p>\n",

Great Special\nAttack combined with the ability to perpetually get rid of status and\nrestore health with virtually no drawbacks turns Zapdos into a powerful\ntank. This set capitalizes on Zapdos's high Special Attack, allowing it\nto slam the numerous physical threats with its powerful STAB or Hidden\nPower. The choice between Thunder and Thunderbolt depends on what your\nteam needs more: power or consistency. Defensive teams will often prefer\nthe consistent accuracy and high PP of Thunderbolt, while offensive\nteams will typically favor Thunder's significantly higher Base Power.\nThunder will allow Zapdos to do far more damage, however, specifically\n2HKOing Miltank and possibly 3HKOing Snorlax with Spikes support or a\ncritical hit; its 30% chance of paralysis also wards off potential\nswitch-ins such as Raikou and Jolteon. Thunderbolt is less powerful than\nThunder, but its perfect accuracy gives it more consistency against\nthreats such as Belly Drum Charizard, Growth Vaporeon, and the\noccasional Swords Dance Tentacruel. Hidden Power Ice offers wonderful\ncoverage against many of the threats Thunder cannot deal with, such as\nRhydon and Exeggutor, as well as opposing Zapdos if you don't want to\nrisk Thunder missing. Together, the two moves have pseudo-BoltBeam\ncoverage, hitting every single Pokemon in OU for neutral damage. Hidden\nPower Water is a notable option if you want to hit Ground-types such as\nRhydon and Steelix harder. However, the extra coverage from Hidden Power\nIce, especially against Exeggutor, is generally more useful. The lasts\ntwo slots are devoted to Rest and Sleep Talk. With these two moves,\nZapdos makes a great status absorber and tank, as well as a more\nconsistent check to Vaporeon and Exeggutor. Sleep Talk eliminates almost\nall of the downsides of using Rest and gives Zapdos the ability to stay\nhealthy and pose a threat. With its good defenses, RestTalk Zapdos will\nbe difficult to take down without a critical hit or a powerful, super\neffective attack, such as Rock Slide or Ice Beam.</p>\n<p>Running Drill Peck over Hidden Power Ice will give Zapdos a better\nmatch-up against threats such as Heracross, Machamp, and Exeggutor, but\nthe loss of coverage is notable. Zapdos can also consider running Hidden\nPower Grass to deal a lot of damage to Quagsire that switch in expecting\nto sponge Thunder or Hidden Power Ice.</p>\n<p>Zapdos loves Spikes support because its main counters, namely Quagsire,\nExeggutor, and Raikou are all grounded and will be far easier to deal\nwith after Spikes damage. Cloyster makes a great partner in this regard,\nas it can both lay Spikes and hammer troublesome Ground-types with Surf.\nOffensive partners such as Gengar and Exeggutor are a great help to\nZapdos as well, because they lure in the three major walls that trouble\nZapdos--Blissey, Raikou, and Snorlax--and can use a strong Explosion to\nKO or severely weaken them. Exeggutor can check Quagsire with ease while\nGengar acts as an effective lure to it. Zapdos also enjoys support from\nSnorlax, which can take on problematic opponents such as Raikou,\nJolteon, and Blissey, while a Raikou of your own will take on opposing\nElectric-types with ease. On more defensive teams, Zapdos enjoys support\nfrom a good Snorlax check such as Skarmory or Miltank. With Toxic,\nSpikes, and phazing support, Zapdos can become truly terrifying.</p>\n"

Quagsire\nis a wonderful counter as it doesn't mind taking either Hidden Power Ice\nor Water and can absorb Thunder. Steelix also works as an effective\npivot for teams looking to bring in a check to Zapdos against a\nrelatively weak Hidden Power Ice. Steelix can also set up Curse and\nthreaten Zapdos with a +1 Rock Slide; it can also phaze or use Explosion\nin an emergency. As it takes little from Zapdos's attacks, Jolteon can\nuse Zapdos as setup bait. After it grabs an Agility or Growth, Jolteon\ncan Baton Pass a deadly Speed or offensive boost to a teammate such as\nMarowak or Snorlax to help them sweep Zapdos's team. Tyranitar also gets\na mention as a check because of its powerful Rock Slide, but it makes a\npoor switch-in to Thunder.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Defensive Tyranitar takes advantage of its solid defensive stats and\nunique defensive typing to act as a phazer for some of the most\nprominent threats in GSC. In particular, defensive Tyranitar is an\neffective phazer for Fire Blast Snorlax, Misdreavus, Jolteon, and\nUmbreon. Roar Tyranitar also helps to check more obscure threats such as\nEspeon, Muk, and Clefable.</p>\n<p>The first two moves are a given; Rock Slide is Tyranitar's best STAB\nattack, whereas Roar defines the set. The last two moves could actually\nbe filled in with several options. Curse is shown because it's common,\nand in conjunction with Roar, it allows Tyranitar to defend against\nthreats such as Snorlax with Earthquake, and to possibly set up a\nlate-game sweep. Rest keeps Tyranitar around for the long haul; without\nRest, Tyranitar can eventually be worn away by Toxic, Spikes, and\nresidual damage racked up as the battle wears on.</p>\n<p>Other move options for the last two slots are too numerous to list. The\nbest options are Fire Blast, Crunch, Earthquake, and Pursuit. Fire Blast\nlets Tyranitar threaten Exeggutor and Skarmory in the event that they\nmight choose to stay in against Tyranitar. Crunch also lets Tyranitar\nhurt Exeggutor while giving it a more reliable way to hurt Ghost-types\nthat choose to stay in, in addition to allowing it to force Miltank out\nvia Special Defense drops and to prevent Starmie from switching in to\nspin away Spikes. Earthquake is good for neutral damage against most\nthings that resist Rock, such as Machamp and Marowak, and also allows\nTyranitar to 2HKO Muk and Nidoking. Pursuit is Tyranitar's best\noffensive move, allowing it to support its team by hitting Pokemon that\nswitch out. It's great for sniping the Ghosts that wall non-Earthquake\nSnorlax, and is also good for chipping away at opponents such as Zapdos\nthat will be inclined flee from Tyranitar. Pursuit is most effective\nwhen Tyranitar has an attacking move other than Rock Slide that allows\nit to force more switches.</p>\n<p>Defensive Tyranitar works well as a defensive supplement to Skarmory.\nTyranitar handles variants of Snorlax without Earthquake, whereas\nSkarmory handles those without Fire Blast. For this reason, Tyranitar\nbacks up Skarmory as a Snorlax check in the event that Snorlax either\nuses Fire Blast or incapacitates Skarmory with Lovely Kiss.</p>\n<p>Tyranitar as a phazer is primarily defensive; it's generally not a great\nSpikes shuffler as it takes a surprising amount of damage from a lot of\nattacks, and has quite a few exploitable weaknesses. If it is going to\nbe offensive, it's accomplishing offense through the use of Pursuit. For\nthis reason, Tyranitar pairs well with mono-attacking Snorlax by sniping\nout the Ghost-types that wall it. If Tyranitar has Crunch or Fire Blast,\nTyranitar also pairs well with Pokemon such as Marowak, Vaporeon, and\nMachamp, which can capitalize on Tyranitar's ability to beat Exeggutor.</p>\n<p>Tyranitar has a couple of big flaws; one of the biggest is its\nvulnerability to Toxic. If, for example, you want to try to forgo Rest\nso that Tyranitar can provide offensive support via Pursuit, Tyranitar\nshould be paired with a user of Heal Bell to make sure it isn't put on a\ntimer when something such as Skarmory nails it with Toxic. Heal Bell is\na good idea even if you choose not to forgo Rest; Tyranitar can be dead\nweight while asleep. In addition, pairing Tyranitar with another phazer\nallows a team to avoid being totally dependent on Tyranitar, which is\nvery vulnerable to passive damage and Toxic, for its phazing needs. This\nsecondary phazer should ideally cover some of the threats that Tyranitar\nis unable to handle, such as Scizor and Earthquake Snorlax.</p>\n"

Dynamic Punch is the primary move\nthat allows Tyranitar to act effectively as a mixed attacker. It allows\nTyranitar to instantly threaten Snorlax and hurt Miltank and Umbreon on\nthe switch. Without Dynamic Punch, these common Pokemon wall Tyranitar\nperpetually.</p>\n<p>Rock Slide is Tyranitar's strongest STAB move and allows Tyranitar to\n2HKO Zapdos; this is key, as other mixed attackers such as Nidoking and\nDragonite struggle mightily against Zapdos, only managing 3HKOs while\nZapdos is able to hit them hard in return. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar\nto hurt Steel-types and Exeggutor. Pursuit is listed because, while it\ndoes little to improve Tyranitar's type coverage or ability to hurt\nswitch-ins, it does allow Tyranitar to chip away at the things it is\nable to beat. STAB Pursuit is Tyranitar's biggest advantage over other\nmixed attackers; Tyranitar is walled by Suicune and Vaporeon regardless\nof its set, and as a result, using Pursuit to chip away at walls is how\nTyranitar is able to consistently play an offensive role.</p>\n<p>Other options in the non-Dynamic Punch slots include Crunch, Earthquake,\nand Thunderbolt. Crunch allows Tyranitar to hurt Starmie and to deal\nbetter damage to Misdreavus, which might stay in fearing Pursuit.\nEarthquake allows Tyranitar to 2HKO Raikou, Muk, and Nidoking, all of\nwhich can otherwise easily take whatever Tyranitar dishes out. Both\nmoves offer Tyranitar a decent attack to hurt what its other moves can't\nfor at least neutral damage. Thunderbolt lets it flat-out beat Cloyster\nhead-to-head and actually do some significant damage to Suicune as it\nswitches in.</p>\n<p>Tyranitar's moveset has a lot of room for customization. The moveset\nprovided probably gives it the best chance for general success, but if\nyou know specifically what you want out of Tyranitar, you can and should\ntack on the moves to let it fill those niches and hit the appropriate\ntargets.</p>\n<p>Again, if Tyranitar is packing Pursuit, it generally makes teammates\nsuch as mono-attacking Snorlax very happy thanks to its ability to snipe\nGhost-types. Pokemon such as Marowak that enjoy a dead Exeggutor or\nweakened Skarmory also appreciate Tyranitar's trapping abilities.\nOffensive Tyranitar is generally more capable than defensive Tyranitar\nwhen it comes to using Pursuit, as it has more attacks with which to\nforce targets to switch out.</p>\n<p>One thing to note about offensive Tyranitar is that, while it's\ngenerally doing more damage and forcing a more narrow range of plays by\nthe opponent, it's also doing next to nothing defensively; it really\nneeds Roar if it's going to do much on defense. As a result, it's no\nlonger checking Fire Blast Snorlax without Roar, nor is it checking\nBaton Pass Espeon. As a result, using offensive Tyranitar means having\nto use something else to take over Tyranitar's traditional role as a\nphazer and Fire Blast Snorlax check.</p>\n<p>If Tyranitar is trying to be self-sufficient offense rather than\nPursuit-based support offense, using Pokemon such as Steelix, that can\nbait and explode on Tyranitar's common walls, such as Suicune, can free\nup the defensive landscape for a Tyranitar rampage. The cool thing about\nTyranitar is that it resists Explosion, so although it's more easily\nwalled than other mixed attackers, if you can take out its walls, it\nisn't stopped by a defensive Explosion unlike other offensive\npowerhouses.</p>\n"

Its\nbiggest selling point, in particular, is its niche as the only STAB\nPursuit user that is reasonably sturdy (unlike Houndoom) and whose\nPursuit is reasonably strong (unlike Umbreon). This allows it to check\nand KO prominent threats such as Gengar and Exeggutor which can\notherwise create problems for teams with their combination of attacking\nprowess, status moves, and Explosion.

Something along the lines of Rock Slide / Earthquake / Fire\nBlast / Curse might make Tyranitar an effective Curse sweeper. However,\ndue to the lack of a particularly strong physical STAB, this kind of set\nis mediocre on Tyranitar compared to other Curse sweepers such as\nMachamp and Rhydon, so it's usually best for Tyranitar to rely on STAB\nPursuit and its mixed attacking movepool for offense. Surf and Ice Beam\nare other special attacking options on Tyranitar; they can help\nTyranitar overcome its tendency to give Ground-types an easy switch-in\nopportunity, though generally these options are fairly mediocre.\nTyranitar's set should focus on beating what it's supposed to, rather\nthan spreading it too thin trying to help it beat what it isn't. Toxic\nis generally a mediocre move option as well, though it can be handy on\nCurse Tyranitar to help it force Miltank to waste Heal Bells, Umbreon to\nRest, and to let it punish switch-ins such as Machamp and Marowak.</p>\n<p>Some gimmicks that might prove effective on Tyranitar include Ancient\nPower and Screech. The former might be good for across-the-board stat\nboosts, the latter for forcing switches and allowing Tyranitar to hurt\nfoes such as Snorlax against which it would otherwise rely on the\ninaccurate Dynamic Punch to do damage. Both are fairly poor move\noptions, though, and should generally be avoided for more practical\nmoves.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Tyranitar is hard walled by Suicune and Vaporeon no matter the set. Less\ncommon universal Tyranitar walls include Sleep Talk Machamp and\nQuagsire. Aside from the above, Miltank and Umbreon make solid checks,\nbut fear Dynamic Punch. Snorlax also becomes a check if Tyranitar isn't\nrunning Dynamic Punch, though it needs to be wary of Rock Slide\nflinches. Marowak switches in well on Rock Slide and gets a free turn to\nattack once it does get in, but it can't afford to take too many\nCrunches or Earthquakes on the switch. Heracross switches in well, as it\nis decently defensive, usually has RestTalk, and forces Tyranitar out\nimmediately, though it does not like switching in on Fire Blast and\ntakes a considerable amount of damage from Rock Slide on the switch.\nRaikou, Nidoking, and Rhydon wall and set up counter-offensives against\nTyranitar if it isn't using Earthquake. Steelix is a hard wall if\nTyranitar isn't using Earthquake or Fire Blast; Forretress sets Spikes\nup in its face if it forgoes Fire Blast. Without Crunch, Starmie is a\ngood Tyranitar counter. Without Thunderbolt, Tyranitar no longer\nthreatens Cloyster with an attack that does 69%-80% in a single hit.\nThis means that Cloyster can afford to stay in and set up Spikes,\nalthough it still isn't exactly a &quot;counter&quot; because it still takes a lot\nof damage (44%-52%) from Rock Slide, Crunch, or Fire Blast. Weirdly\nenough, Zapdos counters any Tyranitar that lacks Rock Slide. Even\nweirder is that Giga Drain Exeggutor counters Tyranitar if it lacks Fire\nBlast or Crunch.</p>\n<p>Aside from the myriad set-dependent walls, Tyranitar is also effectively\nruined by Toxic and passive damage. Unexpected things such as Dynamic\nPunch from Gengar, Toxic from Fire Blast Snorlax, or Exeggutor using\nGiga Drain as Tyranitar switches in can all contribute to Tyranitar's\nuntimely demise, so be sure to abuse them when you can if your team\nstruggles against Tyranitar.</p>\n",

Ice Punch hits all Ground-types but Piloswine, Quagsire,\nand Steelix super effectively. Fire Punch covers Steelix and the rare\nPiloswine, leaving only Quagsire, who, like Piloswine, is rare. Fire\nPunch also nails Scizor and Forretress on their 4x weakness as an added\nbonus. That leaves only Grass- and Electric-types resisting Thunderbolt\n(all fully evolved Dragons are neutral to Thunderbolt, although Ice\nPunch still hits Dragonite hard). Grass-types are covered by both Fire\nPunch and Ice Punch. This means that only enemy Electrics (and the UU\nQuagsire) can resist your primary STAB attack and not be weak to one of\nthe punches.</p>\n<p>However, Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon can just wall most special\nattackers with ease, so if those were Electabuzz's only attacks, then it\nstill couldn't dent them, neutral Thunderbolt or otherwise. This is\nwhere Cross Chop comes in. Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon, the three most\ncommon special walls in GSC, all share a common weakness: Fighting.\nCross Chop has a 25% chance to get a critical hit, so if that goes off\nonce, it will 2HKO Snorlax and potentially OHKO Blissey. It has to roll\nmax damage on both hits to 2HKO Umbreon with one critical hit, but\nUmbreon isn't as dangerous to Electabuzz as the other two, nor is it as\ncommon. Another advantage of Cross Chop is that critical hits ignore\nstat-ups entirely, meaning that it will do the same damage to a Snorlax\nthat has six Curses as it does to one with no Curses. Cross Chop also\nnails the common Tyranitar for a cool 60-71%, an easy 2HKO.</p>\n<p>Leftovers is generally the preferred choice for Electabuzz, because it\nlets it switch into Thunderbolts, Surfs, and non-STAB Ice Beams more\noften, and it also lessens the effect of Spikes. Miracle Berry is a\nsound choice, however, as constant switch-ins to Thunderbolts and Ice\nBeams give Electabuzz a high risk of being paralyzed or frozen.\nElectabuzz is too frail for Leftovers to make that much of a difference,\nso it's not as important as on sturdier Pokemon.</p>\n"

First, Thunder Wave + Cross Chop is an illegal\ncombination, so you cannot hit Blissey, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Umbreon\nvery hard. You can solve this by using Zap Cannon instead of Fire Punch.\nYou do not want to lose Thunderbolt here because, although you would\nalready have Zap Cannon as an Electric attack, you'll find that its\nconsistency of damage is far more useful than hitting Forretress,\nPiloswine, Scizor, and Steelix, so drop Fire Punch and keep Thunderbolt\nand Cross Chop. However, this still runs into the other problem of\ntrying to counter Electric-types in this manner. You stop Jolteon and\ncripple enemy Electabuzz, but the most common Electric-type by far,\nRaikou, almost always carries Rest, meaning it will just heal itself of\nstatus. You can use this to your advantage, however, if you want to set\nup a Belly Drum Charizard. BellyZard has trouble sweeping if the\nopponent has a healthy Raikou kicking around on their team, because it's\nfaster than Charizard and easily OHKOs it with Thunderbolt. If you can\nparalyze their Raikou, when you bring out Charizard later in the game,\nyou can use Belly Drum and not have to worry about them switching to\nRaikou and forcing you to switch. The other popular Electric, Zapdos, is\nweak to Ice Punch and doesn't resist Thunderbolt, so it's not as much of\nan issue.</p>\n<p>Reflect and Light Screen help both Electabuzz and the team survive.\nWhich one you use depends on what you have problems with.

Heal Bell is an amazing support move because it\nallows Pokemon that lack reliable recovery to use Rest, switch out, and\nthen have their sleep removed so they can jump back into the fray at\nfull health. The usefulness of Rest and Heal Bell as a strategy cannot\nbe understated. The extra moveslot is incredibly useful for many Pokemon\nand allows instant recovery to be viable for many sweepers. Getting rid\nof nasty poison and paralysis with Heal Bell is also useful, especially\nagainst stall teams. Without Toxic damage, many stall teams will\nstruggle to do anything meaningful against Miltank and its teammates.\nMiltank also has Milk Drink's recovery, which, combined with Heal Bell,\ncan allow Miltank to plop its large derriere down and stall in its own\nright.</p>\n<p>Heal Bell and Milk Drink are great, but Growl and Body Slam are what\nreally set Miltank apart from other Heal Bell users such as Blissey.\nCompared to Blissey, Miltank has better Speed, Defense, and Attack.\nMiltank can also use Growl, allowing it to serve as a great Snorlax\ncheck by removing the Attack boosts from Curse. Growl Miltank serves as\na great check to Curse users in general because it can use Growl's 64 PP\nto outstall Curse's 16 PP and prevent Curse users from gaining any\nAttacks boosts with which to sweep. Pokemon such as Tyranitar,\nHeracross, and Rhydon will all struggle to get any sort of boosts with\nCurse, and can be easily crippled by Body Slam's paralysis rate. The\nparalysis rate from Body Slam is especially concerning for opponents\nwithout any way to remove status because they will often find themselves\ncrippled and setup bait for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>Miltank also has great Speed, giving it the chance to nullify its\nopponent's Attack with Growl or use Milk Drink before they land a\npossibly lethal blow. This combination of bulk and Speed can make\nMiltank very difficult to take down. Growl has the practical benefit of\nessentially boosting Miltank's Defense while refraining from lowering\nits Speed, as is the case with Curse. In order to remove the Attack\ndrops from Growl, the opponent is forced to switch out. Forcing these\nkinds of switches is great for offensive momentum and stopping Curse\nsweepers in their tracks. Body Slam's 30% paralysis rate serves well\nalongside Growl by crippling both the physical attacker's Speed and\nAttack. Miltank is a great counter to physical attackers, but be wary of\nusers of Curse that also carry Substitute, though they are rare. Snorlax\nwith Belly Drum is also capable of breaking through Miltank's defenses.</p>\n<p>Miltank is easy to fit on most defensive, and even some offensive,\nteams. Miltank's ability to remove status easily with Heal Bell is\nwonderful when paired with bulky sweepers that need recovery but don't\nwant to give up two moveslots to Rest and Sleep Talk. Miltank works well\nwith literally any Pokemon that needs Rest, but also needs to ditch\nSleep Talk to help its own coverage. Notable partners include Snorlax\nwith Belly Drum, Raikou, and Suicune. With Heal Bell support, Snorlax\ncan use Belly Drum, attack until its health gets low, Rest, switch out\nto Miltank, and then switch in to use Belly Drum again once Miltank uses\nHeal Bell; Marowak is in the same boat, except with Swords Dance over\nBelly Drum. Skarmory makes a good partner because it can wall the few\nphysical threats that Miltank struggles to take down, such as Marowak\nand Belly Drum Snorlax. Raikou and Suicune can also work well alongside\nMiltank because of their ability to take special attacks and to deal out\ndamage with Thunderbolt and Surf, respectively.</p>\n"

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Miltank does have a few other options it can utilize. Psych Up has its\noccasional uses; stealing a Belly Drum, Swords Dance, or Curse boost and\nsweeping is fun, but lacks the consistency of Curse or Growl and is\ngenerally a riskier option. Earthquake can be used if you feel like\nMiltank needs the coverage, and Seismic Toss can be used if you want to\nhave more consistent damage output against Steel-types, but both are\ngenerally outclassed by Body Slam and Growl. Curse is a possibility, but\nSnorlax, Kangaskhan, or Porygon2 will generally serve you much better in\nthat regard.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Miltank is a great support Pokemon, but it isn't without its counters.\nSpecial attacks are the bane of Miltank's existence. Zapdos doesn't give\na rip about paralysis because of RestTalk, and it has Thunder to slam\nMiltank's weak Special Defense. Vaporeon's access to Growth and Surf\nmake it a major thorn in Miltank's side. It can easily set up and shrug\noff any paralysis because of its low Speed. After one Growth, Surf is\nalmost always a 2HKO. Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress all resist\nNormal-type moves and can either phaze Miltank or set up entry hazards.\nMachamp is also notable because of it is one of the few Curse users that\nMiltank cannot counter with Growl. Machamp's super effective Cross Chop\nwill do heavy damage, 2HKOing Miltank with no boosts and OHKOing after\none boost from Curse.</p>\n<p>Any Pokemon with sleep moves will pose a threat to Miltank as long as\nSleep Clause hasn't been activated; Pokemon such as Exeggutor and\nNidoking work in this regard. Exeggutor can also use Explosion to nail\nMiltank if need be. However, if Sleep Clause has already been activated\nor Lovely Kiss misses, Nidoking will be unable to check Miltank, and\nwill find itself countered by Miltank instead. Gengar works as a counter\nbecause it takes no damage from Body Slam and has a slew of special\nattacks to fire at Miltank. Misdreavus works much like Gengar, but with\nMean Look and Perish Song instead of an all-out assault.</p>\n<p>Forretress also deserves a special mention as a check because of its\nability to set up Spikes while taking a pittance from any of Miltank's\nattacks. Forretress doesn't mind paralysis, and the reduction in\nattacking power from Growl is not as important to it as it is to Pokemon\nsuch as Snorlax. Cloyster functions in the same way with the additional\nability to fire off Surfs at Miltank's lower Special Defense stat. Keep\nin mind that Miltank's high Defense and access to Milk Drink and Heal\nBell will make it difficult to wear down with Toxic. However, while time\nconsuming, it is possible to outstall Heal Bell's PP with Toxic,\nassuming Miltank stays in. Miltank, however, doesn't enjoy being put to\nsleep or frozen. It cannot remove these status conditions with Heal\nBell, meaning that it will be crippled in its main position as a status\nremover. That being said, strong special attacks remain the best way to\ntake down Miltank.</p>\n",

STAB Earthquake is, aside from the\nElectric immunity, one of the biggest perks to being a Ground-type, so\nit's a must on Steelix to allow it to threaten relevant damage against\nfoes. Curse is also required, as it allows Steelix to bolster its Attack\nto levels at which neutral Earthquakes actually threaten significant\ndamage. Curse is the main way Steelix manages to create offensive\npressure, especially in conjunction with Roar. Roar allows Steelix to\nprevent itself from being phazed by Pokemon such as Skarmory while it is\nsetting up Curses, and furthermore can be used to shuffle the opponent's\nteam to either scout or accumulate Spikes damage. Roar is also fantastic\ndefensively, as Steelix is capable of countering several threats such as\nCurse Snorlax, Perish trap Misdreavus, and Baton Pass Jolteon, Espeon,\nand Umbreon.</p>\n<p>The last move depends on what you want out of Steelix. Explosion allows\nSteelix to break walls instead of simply applying offensive pressure.\nAfter a Curse, a full-health Steelix can survive Suicune's Surf and\nguarantee an OHKO in return with Explosion. Other threats, such as\nZapdos and Miltank, are guaranteed to fall to a +1 Explosion, and Zapdos\nin particular is likely to be OHKOed and takes at least 93% damage from\nan unboosted Explosion. Explosion can also come in handy against\nSnorlax, even Fire Blast variants that Steelix otherwise struggles to\nbeat. An unboosted Explosion does 80-94% to Snorlax, so you will need a\nlittle bit of residual damage to make this into an OHKO. Skarmory can\nalso be KOed by Explosion if Steelix is able to set up enough Curses\nbeforehand--at least 4 Curses are needed to guarantee an OHKO against an\nunboosted Skarmory, whereas 6 are needed to have a roughly 70% chance of\nOHKOing a +1 Skarmory. On the other hand, Rock Slide is a more\nconservative option that allows Steelix to 3HKO Zapdos after a Curse\nwithout needing to Explode. Furthermore, Rock Slide allows Steelix to\nsweep late-game when none of the opposing Pokemon can hurt it, even if\nthe opponent has an Earthquake-immune Zapdos or Skarmory. Rock Slide can\nalso severely punish Charizard switch-ins without the risk involved with\nExplosion. However, it's important to note that outside of trying to\ncatch Charizard, Rock Slide is useless without Curses behind it, as it\nfails to even 3HKO Zapdos without a boost. Finally, Body Slam is an\noption for Steelix's last moveslot. Body Slam does not threaten to\noutright KO a wall the way Explosion can, and since it only does 24-28%\nto Skarmory when Steelix is at +6 Attack, it does not allow Steelix to\nsweep, either. However, Body Slam allows Steelix to spread paralysis,\nthereby allowing it to support its team much more effectively than it\nwould have been able to otherwise.</p>\n<p>Steelix is best used on offensive teams as a defensive pivot to switch\ninto Snorlax and Electric-types. It's immune to Thunder and takes only\nneutral damage from Ice moves, giving it &quot;perfect&quot; defensive coverage\nagainst the vaunted BoltBeam coverage touted by Zapdos, Raikou, and\nGengar. Its high Defense and Steel typing allow it to tank Snorlax\nDouble-Edges better than any other non-Ghost-type Pokemon, and\nfurthermore its Defense is high enough to take merely 27-31% from\nSnorlax's unboosted Earthquake. These are the match-ups that make\nSteelix great, so it's best to use Steelix to either attempt to mount\npressure against an opposing Snorlax or to chain-switch around Hidden\nPower Zapdos to get your own Snorlax or Tyranitar in on an innocuous\nHidden Power instead of a powerful Thunder. However, always be wary of\nFire Blast on Snorlax and Hidden Power Water on Zapdos or Raikou, as\nthese can ruin Steelix's strong match-up against these foes. The\npossibility of these moves is part of what makes Explosion the standard\nfourth move over Rock Slide; at least with Explosion you can salvage the\nsituation when unable to sweep against a non-standard Snorlax or Zapdos\nset and take something down with Steelix.</p>\n<p>Steelix tends to work best with Spikes support so it can use Roar to\naccumulate damage against the opposing team. Typically, Cloyster is the\nSpiker of choice to pair with Steelix. Defensively, Steelix synergizes\nwell with Exeggutor, which can switch in against and torment Raikou and\nZapdos that opt for Hidden Power Water over Hidden Power Ice. Misdreavus\nis also a good partner since it can handle Fire Blast Snorlax while\nspinblocking to keep Spikes down for Steelix. As for offensive support\nto pair with Steelix, this depends on whether Steelix is running\nExplosion, Body Slam, or Rock Slide. Steelix with Explosion helps break\nwalls for the team, so Pokemon that struggle with its common Explosion\ntargets are good teammates. Vaporeon, Machamp, and Charizard are a few\nteammates that appreciate Explosion Steelix's ability to take Suicune\nand Zapdos out of the game. If Steelix runs Body Slam, it isn't breaking\nwalls but rather afflicting them with status to allow other attackers to\nbeat them. Nidoking and Marowak are absolutely thrilled by Steelix's\nability to paralyze Zapdos and Suicune for them, whereas Belly Drum\nSnorlax and Machamp can capitalize off of Steelix's ability to paralyze\nSkarmory. However, if Steelix uses Rock Slide, it aims to be a more\neffective Spikes shuffler by threatening damage against Zapdos, while\nalso looking for a potential late-game sweep. Thus, Steelix will need to\nreceive support rather than supply it. Steelix's common counters include\nSuicune and Growl Miltank, so teammates that can KO or paralyze these\nthreats so Steelix can sweep will help it immensely. In particular,\nmixed Snorlax with Self-Destruct or Body Slam can threaten to KO or\nparalyze Miltank and Suicune.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Steelix is an anomaly in that it's a primarily defensive Ground-type. It\nhas incredible Defense and resists Normal-type attacks, letting it\ncounter Snorlax, and its Steel / Ground typing gives it a crucial\nElectric immunity paired with neutrality to Ice-type attacks, thereby\nmaking it a safe switch-in to Electrics with Hidden Power. It's also one\nof the best go-to defensive phazers for responding to threats such as\nPerish trap Misdreavus and Baton Pass Jolteon. However, while Steelix\nsurpasses other Ground-types defensively, it falls incredibly short of\ntheir offensive prowess with an Attack stat of 268. Still, Steelix is\nnot totally inept. With Spikes down, it can use Roar to shuffle the\nopponent's Pokemon with the best of them, and it can set up Curses to\npressure the opponent or even sweep in a late-game situation where all\nthe Pokemon capable of hurting Steelix are KOed. It also gets Explosion\nto instantly take out a wall. Overall, Steelix is an excellent defensive\npivot and emergency phazer that, while offensively handicapped compared\nto other Ground-types, can still threaten foes.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Curse could be foregone to allow both Body Slam and Explosion on the\nsame set to maximize Steelix's potential for immediate offensive impact.\nWith a set of Earthquake, Body Slam, Explosion, and Roar, Steelix can\nstill Spikes shuffle and phaze out dangerous threats while both\nspreading paralysis and having Explosion for walls such as Suicune or\nZapdos. However, Steelix is generally better suited to building pressure\nby setting up Curses. Iron Tail could be used as an alternative STAB\nthat, by virtue of the lack of Pokemon immune to it, actually allows\nmono-attacking Steelix to sweep at +6. However, Steel is in general a\nterrible attacking type, and furthermore it is only 75% accurate and\nalso incapable of forcing Raikou to switch out. Substitute can be paired\nwith Curse and Roar to dodge Growl and Charm while setting up a sweep.\nIron Tail is the ideal attacking move on such a set to ensure nothing\ncan wall a +6 Steelix. Bind can be paired with Explosion to make sure\nSteelix takes out the appropriate target.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Water-types are the chief counters that force Steelix to switch out\nwhile taking little damage in return from Steelix's Earthquake. Suicune,\nVaporeon, Cloyster, and even Starmie are all excellent switch-ins to\nSteelix. Exeggutor is also a fine switch-in to Steelix that resists\nEarthquake while threatening to use Sleep Powder or whittle away its\nhealth with Psychic, Giga Drain, or Hidden Power Fire. Heracross, while\nnot as common, can switch into Steelix, resists Earthquake, and can\nwhittle away its health with Seismic Toss. Some more passive switch-ins\nto Steelix are Growl Miltank and Charm Umbreon, which shut Steelix down\nby negating the Attack boosts it gets from Curse. However, these\ncounters cannot actually hurt Steelix, thereby allowing it to gain\nLeftovers recovery or switch out to a threatening special attacker, such\nas Zapdos, that does not mind taking a Growl or Charm on the switch.</p>\n<p>Steelix is also countered, to an extent, by Flying-types. Zapdos and\nDragonite, especially if they use Hidden Power Water or Fire Blast,\nrespectively, are great answers to Steelix. Their Flying typing, at the\nvery least, forces Explosion Steelix to trade lives with them, although\nswitching one of these Pokemon into a Rock Slide Steelix is a dicey\nproposition, especially if Steelix uses Curse on the switch-in to enable\nthe Rock Slide 3HKO. Charizard is an unconventional Pokemon, but it is\nsimilar to Zapdos and Dragonite in that it at worst trades with\nExplosion Steelix while struggling to switch into Rock Slide Steelix.\nCharizard, however, can OHKO Steelix with STAB Fire Blast, so it fears\nswitching into Rock Slide more than it fears switching into a Curse.\nSkarmory, too, is similar in that it forces Explosion Steelix to trade\nwith it, while Rock Slide Steelix ultimately beats Skarmory if it is the\nonly decent answer to Steelix left. However, Steelix must hit Skarmory\non the switch with Rock Slide, as it must use Roar against an active\nSkarmory to avoid being phazed and losing its boosts. Thus, if Skarmory\nis paired with another Pokemon that can easily tank Rock Slides,\nSkarmory can attempt to stall Steelix out of PP. This is made even\neasier if Skarmory is using the uncommon Sand Attack set.</p>\n<p>Certain physical threats can also come in to capitalize off of Steelix's\nweaknesses. Marowak can handily 2HKO with Earthquake, although its\nEarthquake is downgraded to a 3HKO if Steelix has a Curse set up, so\nMarowak cannot switch into an active Steelix and instead must switch in\nas Steelix switches in. Machamp is similar, except its unboosted Cross\nChop only 3HKOes, although the high critical hit ratio means that Cross\nChop can potentially OHKO Steelix. Again, though, a Steelix that has set\nup Curse can tank these hits (unboosted Cross Chop from Machamp only\ndoes 30-35% to Steelix after a Curse), so Machamp must switch in as\nSteelix switches in, rather than switching into an active Steelix. Of\ncourse, these Pokemon and several others could also be using Fire Blast\nto roast Steelix for at least a 3HKO on the special side, meaning that\neven if they are brought in by Roar against a Steelix with several\nCurses, they could stay in despite the Defense boosts and still do heavy\ndamage. Even Pokemon that Steelix normally counters, such as Snorlax,\ncan easily turn the tables on Steelix with Fire Blast.</p>\n",

Tentacruel is a decent counter, but it doesn't\nhave a recovery move, so some well-placed Thunder Punches will hurt\nTentacruel enough. To be honest, anything that can take more than one\nhit and has a powerful STAB attack can be considered a Magmar counter,\nsince it can't take more than two hits or so. There's a reason why\nMagmar is UU.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set has one major goal: get Spikes down and keep them there.\nForretress will have plenty of opportunities to switch in and set up\nentry hazards thanks to its myriad of resistances and great Defense\nstat. The move options are fairly simple and can be tailored to fit an\nindividual team's needs. The first moveslot is dedicated to Spikes,\nwhich should be Forretress's first priority upon switching in. Once\nSpikes are down, Forretress has several options to choose from while\nsupporting its team. Hidden Power Bug is a great option because it will\nthreaten Starmie, the most common spinner in OU, with a 2HKO. This kind\nof pressure makes the opponent hard-pressed to bring in their spinner,\nallowing for more opportunities to rack up Spikes damage. The last two\nmoveslots allow Forretress the flexibility to play slightly different\nsupport roles. With Rapid Spin, Forretress can transition from Spikes\nuser to Spikes remover. While Forretress surely isn't the best spinner\navailable, it can still support its team by removing Spikes once the\nopponent's Spikes user has been KOed. Toxic is useful in the last slot\nto nail Cloyster switch-ins and is a great option against Misdreavus\nlooking to block Rapid Spin. At the very least, it will force opponents\nto use Rest or Heal Bell sooner than they would have liked. Explosion is\na more offensive option that allows Forretress to make good use of its\nbase 90 Attack. Forretress's Explosion is slow but useful in emergency\nsituations against Snorlax, Vaporeon, or Marowak, all of which can\neasily set up on Forretress while it uses Spikes. However, mispredicting\nan Explosion can be extremely detrimental as Forretress is usually the\nonly Spikes user on its team. Losing it can give the opponent an\nimportant advantage in laying and removing Spikes. Forretress's\nExplosion is not nearly as dangerous as Cloyster's and should be used\nwith good judgment or when completely necessary. It should also be noted\nthat Forretress can use that fourth slot to run a set with Explosion,\nRapid Spin, and Spikes, a move combination that Cloyster cannot use.</p>\n<p>This set might seem similar to the one Cloyster runs, but it plays very\ndifferently. Forretress is more defensive than Cloyster and often\nfocuses on retaining Spikes in the long run. Forretress works well on\nteams centered around taking advantage of Spikes in a stall-heavy\nmetagame. One great teammate is Misdreavus, which can wall Rapid Spin\nand Explosion while threatening opponents with a Perish Song + Mean Look\ncombo. Phazers such as Raikou, Skarmory, and Suicune pair wonderfully\nwith Spikes support. Skarmory offers not only Whirlwind support, but\nalso the ability to check Snorlax that try and set up on Forretress.\nRaikou has complementary Special Defense and the added benefit a STAB\nThunder to threaten opposing users of Rapid Spin and Spikes, such as\nStarmie and Cloyster. Zapdos really enjoys the extra damage Spikes can\nprovide against Snorlax and its many grounded counters, such as Raikou\nand Quagsire. Pursuit support from a Pokemon such as Tyranitar or\nHoundoom will remove or seriously damage any Misdreavus or Gengar\nswitch-ins looking to block Rapid Spin.</p>\n"
        }

      "overview": "<p>What's in a name? A lot if you're talking about Forretress. As the name\nsuggests, Forretress is quite defensive. Great base 140 Defense, base 75\nHP, nine useful resistances, an immunity to Toxic, and only one weakness\nmake Forretress one tough nut to crack. However, if these were all\nForretress had to offer, it's doubtful it would have ever seen much\nusage in OU, as its lack of a phazing move would have relegated it as a\nlesser Skarmory or Steelix. However, this isn't the case for one very\nimportant reason: Forretress has access to Spikes. In a metagame full of\npowerful phazers and stall teams that switch often to gain the upper\nhand, keeping Spikes on the field is incredibly useful. The good news\nfor Forretress is that it is one of only two viable Spikes users in OU,\nthe other being Cloyster. The differences between the two are important.\nCompared to Cloyster, Forretress has far more resistances and STAB\nHidden Power Bug to scare off the most common Rapid Spin user in\nOU--Starmie. Forretress, unlike Cloyster, can also use Explosion,\nSpikes, and Rapid Spin at the same time. Forretress is a wonderful fit\non any team that centers around laying Spikes and keeping them on the\nfield.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Beyond the moves listed above, Forretress has a few other usable\noptions. It can use Reflect over Toxic to boost its Defense to nearly\nimpenetrable levels. Reflect will also benefit Forretress's team if it\nswitches out after setting up Spikes or using Rapid Spin. A set with\nCurse and Rest is usable as it allows Forretress to stall out opposing\nphysical attackers, most notably Heracross and Snorlax. Reflect can be\nused over Curse if team support is more valuable than the Attack boost\nor ability to boost long-term with Curse. The main problems with Curse +\nRest are that it doesn't do much to help Forretress maintain Spikes and\nit doesn't effectively stall out many top threats. Protect is a strange\nbut viable option to allow Forretress to scout for random Fire-type\nmoves from opponents such as Snorlax and Exeggutor while also gaining\nLeftovers recovery and an extra turn of Toxic damage. Protect is also\nuseful for blocking Rapid Spin and the occasional Surf from Cloyster\nduring entry hazard wars. Forretress can also chose to run either Hidden\nPower Fire or Hidden Power Ghost. Hidden Power Fire might sound gimmicky\nconsidering Forretress's low Special Attack, but the ability to 2HKO\nopposing Forretress can be invaluable to your team. Hidden Power Ghost\nis a way to take Misdreavus and Gengar by surprise if they try and block\nRapid Spin or Explosion.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Countering Spikes is the easiest way to counter Forretress. Having a\nhandy spinner such as Cloyster or even your own Forretress is the\neasiest way to prevent an opposing Forretress from doing its job\neffectively. Cloyster is especially notable as a check because it can\n3HKO Forretress with Surf. Cloyster can also use Spikes, forcing the\nopposing Forretress into an entry hazard war that it will struggle to\nwin. Without Hidden Power Fire, Forretress can do nothing to opposing\nForretress. Using a Forretress of your own can force an entry hazard war\nwhere the opponent will be forced to accept Spikes on their side of the\nfield if they chose to switch. Gengar is a perfect counter to the\nstandard Forretress set because of its immunity to Rapid Spin, Toxic,\nand Explosion, resistance to Hidden Power Bug, and access to\nhigh-powered special attacks. A combination of Forretress and Gengar\nwill neuter opposing Forretress and keep Spikes off your side of the\nfield. Misdreavus is another good Forretress check; it can block both\nRapid Spin and Explosion and threaten Forretress with Perish Song and\nMean Look. The threat of Fire Blast from Belly Drum Charizard will force\nForretress to switch, giving Charizard a free turn to set up. Boosting\nsweepers in general are a pain for Forretress. Growth Vaporeon and Curse\nor Belly Drum Snorlax can both easily set up on Forretress as it tries\nto lay Spikes. Snorlax in particular can nail Forretress with a surprise\nFire Blast, giving its team a free KO and a chance to keep their Spikes\non the field. Exeggutor can also net a surprise KO with Hidden Power\nFire on Forretress that stay in hoping to land a 4x super effective\nHidden Power Bug. Zapdos, with its high Special Attack and ability to\nshrug off both Toxic and Hidden Power Bug, will make a good counter to\nany Forretress without Explosion.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set gives Skarmory everything it needs to succeed. With access to\nWhirlwind and Curse, as well as fantastic resistances, Skarmory will be\nable to counter many top OU threats with ease. It can easily come in on\nCurse or Belly Drum Snorlax and phaze it with Whirlwind. Curse allows\nSkarmory to effectively wall Belly Drum Snorlax as well as last-Pokemon\nCurse Snorlax after only one or two boosts. Skarmory can also deal with\nthe likes of Heracross, Marowak, and Machamp, preventing them from\nsweeping or setting up. Additionally, it can serve as an effective check\nto Umbreon and Misdreavus without Thunder, as Whirlwind will stop their\nrespective trap-passing and Perish-trapping attempts.</p>\n<p>Curse gives Skarmory additional Defense boosts, increasing its general\nlongevity. The sheer physical durability of Skarmory after a Curse\ncannot be understated. For example, at +1 Defense, Skarmory will almost\nnever be 3HKOed by Snorlax's 999 Attack Double-Edge, 999 Attack Marowak\ncannot 3HKO with Rock Slide, boosted Steelix can't OHKO with Explosion,\n999 Attack Rhydon never 2HKOes with Rock Slide, and Machamp will fail to\nOHKO with a +1 Cross Chop even with a critical hit. Curse also gives\nSkarmory a Speed drop that lets it phaze other Curse and Roar users,\nsuch as Steelix, Rhydon, and Tyranitar, that would otherwise phaze\nSkarmory instead. While not common, Skarmory can occasionally sweep\nthanks to Curse if Growl users and special attackers such as Zapdos and\nRaikou are removed, but this is a very situational scenario. A quick\nnote on Curse: when using Pokemon Netbattle Supremacy, Skarmory will be\none Speed point faster at -1 than Snorlax; however, when using Pokemon\nOnline, Skarmory at -1 Speed will tie with Snorlax.</p>\n<p>With Drill Peck, Skarmory has an option to deal a good chunk of damage\nto threats such as Machamp, Exeggutor, and Heracross. Skarmory resists\nboth of Exeggutor's STAB moves, and barring Sleep Powder or Hidden Power\nFire, it can switch in with impunity. When going up against Curse\nMachamp, it is a good idea to boost with Curse first before using Drill\nPeck in order to prevent Skarmory from losing a good chunk of its health\nto Cross Chop. Rest is for recovering health and removing paralysis; a\nparalyzed Skarmory will find it more difficult to check Pokemon it would\nnormally beat, such as Swords Dance Marowak, Curse Machamp, and Belly\nDrum Snorlax. However, keep in mind that a sleeping Skarmory won't be\nable to counter threats it normally would, such as setup sweepers and\ntrappers. As a word of warning, opponents can and will capitalize on the\ntwo free turns from Rest. It is recommended that you only use Rest when\ncompletely necessary; Heal Bell support is also a good idea.</p>\n<p>Skarmory is a fantastic physical wall and defensive pivot, but it will\nenjoy help dealing with special threats. Skarmory absolutely loves\nsupport from switch-ins to Electric-types that try to ruin its day.\nSteelix, Quagsire, and Blissey are all able to counter Zapdos and Raikou\neffectively; Nidoking, Rhydon, and Snorlax can also help play around\nthese threats if need be. However, Snorlax will not enjoy being forced\nto absorb powerful special attacks over the course of a longer match.\nPlaying Snorlax defensively is seldom a good idea because it would\nrather use its large bulk to prolong its offensive use. Nidoking and\nRhydon will also have issues against Raikou and Zapdos packing Hidden\nPower Ice or Water. Beyond Raikou and Zapdos, Skarmory will also want\nmixed and special attackers such as Nidoking, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and\nVaporeon covered. Zapdos and Raikou can take on Vaporeon, Dragonite, and\nspecial attackers in general with their special bulk and high Special\nAttack. Suicune is also a good choice for countering special and mixed\nsweepers because of its resistances to Water- and Ice-type attacks, good\nmixed bulk, and access to STAB Surf and Toxic.</p>\n<p>Skarmory also needs help dealing with certain physical threats that can\nplay around it. Lovely Kiss, Thunder, and Fire Blast versions of Snorlax\nare notable for their ability to beat Skarmory one-on-one. Lovely Kiss\nversions will cripple Skarmory with sleep, while Fire Blast versions can\nscore a surprise 2HKO should Skarmory choose to switch in. Tyranitar,\nRhydon, and Misdreavus are all excellent counters to the aforementioned\nSnorlax sets. Gengar and Steelix work best against Lovely Kiss versions,\nthough Gengar will have to watch out for a possible Earthquake. Curse\nusers with Roar, such as Tyranitar, Kangaskhan, and Rhydon, are also\ntroubling for Skarmory, as their Roar will go after Skarmory's Whirlwind\nafter they set up a Curse, causing it to fail. With the combination of\nCurse and Roar, these Pokemon will be able to beat Skarmory without\nspecial attacks. Miltank and Umbreon can neutralize most Curse and Roar\nusers with Growl and Charm, respectively.</p>\n<p>Skarmory and Miltank are great partners, as together they counter\nvirtually every physical threat in the metagame. Miltank can also take\non the mixed Snorlax versions that give Skarmory trouble. Blissey and\nSkarmory complement each other well as partners and make up the famous\n&quot;SkarmBliss&quot; combo. However, in GSC, this partnership is not as strong\nas it is in ADV. Blissey can provide Heal Bell and screen support for\nSkarmory, but other than that it will do little to secure victory.\nSkarmory enjoys phazing support; Raikou works well in this regard\nbecause of its high Special Defense, resistance to Electric-type\nattacks, and access to Roar. Suicune also deserves a mention for its\ngreat mixed defenses, access to Roar, and ability to check mixed Snorlax\nwith Fire Blast. Other great phazing partners include Tyranitar,\nSteelix, and Rhydon, which are notable for their resistance to\nNormal-type attacks and high Defense. Having an extra Snorlax check is a\nwise idea in case Skarmory is put to sleep by Lovely Kiss or surprised\nby Fire Blast. Stall teams should especially consider extra phazing\nsupport for Snorlax in order to prevent it from sweeping once Skarmory\nhas gone down. Additional phazers such as Rhydon can also work well\nagainst Misdreavus with Thunder trying to Perish trap. Skarmory enjoys\nthe stallbreaking prowess that Misdreavus brings to the table with\nPerish Song and Mean Look. Misdreavus can also block Rapid Spin, thereby\nkeeping Spikes on the field. Skarmory is often used in a phazing role\nand therefore loves entry hazards; Forretress and Cloyster are both good\noptions for providing Spikes support.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Since the very beginning of the GSC metagame, Skarmory has proved to be\na force to be reckoned with. With an amazing base 140 Defense stat, 9\nresistances, 2 immunities, and no physical weaknesses, Skarmory is\neasily the best physical wall available in GSC. Throw in Skarmory's\nability to phaze opponents with Whirlwind and boost its already\nridiculous Defense with Curse, and you have an excellent check to top\nthreats such as Snorlax, Marowak, Heracross, Exeggutor, Machamp,\nUmbreon, Quagsire, and Espeon. In addition, Skarmory's resistance to\nNormal-type attacks also makes it a good switch-in to most predicted\nExplosions.</p>\n<p>While Skarmory is an amazing physical wall, it lacks the ability to\neffectively deal with special attacks from most special and mixed\nattackers, the reason being its measly base 70 Special Defense and poor\nbase 65 HP. Skarmory's movepool is also rather limited; beyond Toxic and\nDrill Peck, it has little in the way of offense, and is forced to rely\nupon Rest and Leftovers for healing off damage due to its lack of\nrecovery options. While sleeping, Skarmory will no longer be able to\ncheck some threats, such as Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, Machamp, and\ntrappers, although others, such as Curse Snorlax, non-Seismic Toss\nHeracross, and most Exeggutor, still won't be able to get past Skarmory.\nThat said, Skarmory is still an incredible defensive Pokemon that should\nalways be considered when team building, especially when creating a\nstall-based team. Ignore this bird of steel at your own risk!</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Outside of the moves already mentioned, Skarmory has a few options that\nit can use over Curse. Thief is an interesting possibility because it\ncan remove Leftovers from an opponent, making them more susceptible to\nbeing worn down over time. Keep in mind that Thief only works when\nSkarmory is not carrying an item. Toxic is another option over Curse to\ndrain the opponent's health. However, many Pokemon carry Rest, and Heal\nBell support is also fairly common, so Skarmory will often find it\ndifficult to sufficiently wear down many of the tanks that Toxic is\nmeant to counter; however, Toxic is still useful for forcing certain\nPokemon to waste a turn Resting. Pokemon that often carry Rest without\nSleep Talk, such as Raikou, are especially susceptible to this strategy.\nWearing down Electric-types looking to switch in can be very useful,\nespecially with Spikes support. Toxic will also wear down Tyranitar,\nRhydon, Cloyster, and Dragonite looking for an easy switch-in, and is\neffective against defensive Pokemon that don't have Rest and Sleep Talk,\nsuch as Starmie and Miltank. Sand Attack is another option for Skarmory\nto use against Kangaskhan, and makes a great ploy for annoying opponents\nin general. The accuracy drops can really ruin opponents, especially\nthose that rely on moves without perfect accuracy, such as Thunder\nZapdos and Raikou.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Strong special attacks remain the best way to deal with Skarmory, as\nthey hit its much weaker Special Defense. Electric-types such as Zapdos,\nRaikou, and Jolteon can easily switch into Drill Peck and force Skarmory\nout with a super effective STAB attack. Mixed sweepers such as Nidoking,\nDragonite, Tyranitar, and Fire Blast Snorlax can all come in and do a\ngreat deal of damage to Skarmory. Vaporeon is a deadly special sweeper\nwhich can scare out Skarmory and use the free turn to boost. While not\ncommon, Charizard can come in on Skarmory, threaten it with Fire Blast,\nand use Belly Drum as it switches out. Cloyster and Forretress can\neasily set up Spikes on Skarmory. Steelix, Kangaskhan, Rhydon, and\nTyranitar are all slower than Skarmory after a Curse boost, allowing\nthem to force Skarmory out with Roar after it uses Whirlwind--in GSC,\nphazing moves fail if they go before the opponent moves. Houndoom and\nTyranitar can rack up Pursuit damage on Skarmory by threatening it with\npowerful Fire-type moves. Starmie and Suicune can threaten Skarmory with\na STAB Surf, and Starmie can even get a free turn to clear away Spikes\nwith Rapid Spin. However, be aware that many of the counters mentioned\nabove will be surprised by the occasional Toxic. Snorlax with Fire Blast\ncan surprise Skarmory with a 2HKO, while Lovely Kiss versions can\ncripple Skarmory and then proceed to use Belly Drum to rip through the\nrest of the team.</p>\n",
