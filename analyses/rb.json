          "description": "<p>Thanks to its bulk and useful resistances, Exeggutor is the most\nreliable sleeper in the game, as it will find many opportunities to\nswitch in and put something to sleep via Sleep Powder. Exeggutor has the\nability to take hits from many common Pokemon such as Alakazam,\nExeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Gengar, and can easily switch into\nEarthquakes. Exeggutor can also switch into Chansey as it uses\nSoft-Boiled or Thunderbolt. It can even afford to take Body Slams and\nnon-STAB-boosted Ice-type moves in a pinch. However, Exeggutor is slower\nthan the other two common sleepers, Jynx and Gengar, which means that\nthey will be able to put Exeggutor to sleep before it has a chance to\nreciprocate. For this reason, if Exeggutor is the only Pokemon with a\nsleep move on your team, it's a good idea to switch to another Pokemon,\nsuch as Alakazam or Starmie, to take the sleep and save Exeggutor and\nits Sleep Powder for later. Psychic is Exeggutor's main attacking move,\nand hits any non-Psychic-type Pokemon, except for Chansey, very hard.\nExplosion is Exeggutor's best option against Chansey and Alakazam. It is\nalso very useful against other defensive Pokemon, such as Starmie and\nopposing Exeggutor. Explosion can also work as an emergency stop to\nsweepers such as Tauros, Snorlax, Slowbro, and Zapdos. It is a key move\nin Exeggutor's moveset, as Exeggutor's role in most battles consists of\nspreading status, sponging physical attacks generally from Rhydon,\nGolem, or Snorlax, scaring them off with Psychic, and then Exploding on\na wall or an offensive threat.</p>\n<p>There are three main options for the last slot. Stun Spore is probably\nthe most common of the three; it provides a secondary status move,\nallowing Exeggutor to cripple many of its common switch-ins such as\nAlakazam, Starmie, Jynx, Lapras, opposing Exeggutor, and even Chansey.\nIt's also useful for the occasional match-up with Tauros during the\nlate-game part of the battle. Double-Edge can be useful for common\nswitch-ins with low Defense, such as Alakazam and Jynx, hitting them for\naround 40% damage. Double-Edge gives Exeggutor the chance to take out a\nparalyzed Alakazam switching into it without having to resort to\nExplosion, and might even be able to take out a low health Chansey as\nwell. Double-Edge also hits opposing Exeggutor harder, but due to its\nrecoil, and Psychic's chance to score a Special drop, this doesn't give\nExeggutor much of an advantage over opposing Exeggutor. Mega Drain makes\nExeggutor an even better counter to Rhydon and Golem. It is only a 3HKO\non Starmie, so you will have to paralyze it first. Mega Drain's ability\nto regain HP also helps Exeggutor to stick around longer and potentially\nspread more status. Both attacking moves are good options against\nSlowbro, and help put it at low enough health to be KOed by Explosion.</p>\n"

Exeggutor is easy to fit onto a\nteam thanks to its ability to effectively fulfill many important roles.\nWith access to Sleep Powder, Exeggutor is by far the most common sleeper\nin the game, and is often used as a lead. Its unique typing grants it\nuseful resistances to Psychic and Earthquake. Exeggutor is also bulky\nenough to make good use of these resistances. For this reason, Exeggutor\neffectively deals with Golem and Rhydon, and is able to take a few\nPsychics from the likes of Alakazam and opposing Exeggutor. In addition,\na healthy Exeggutor also works as a decent answer to Snorlax and Tauros,\nespecially if you can switch into them as they use Earthquake. While\nlimited, Exeggutor's offenses should not be underestimated either;\nExeggutor's Psychic gets STAB and comes off a 348 Special stat, and\nExplosion can KO Chansey or a Psychic-type trying to tank Psychic.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Exeggutor is quite versatile for RBY, although it's advisable to stick\nto the standard set's moves. Exeggutor's multitude of resistances and\nits bulkiness allow it to use Rest effectively, especially when combined\nwith paralysis support from other teammates. Hyper Beam is an offensive\nalternative to Double-Edge that can deal around 60% to Alakazam and Jynx\nand almost 50% to Chansey, being useful when they have been previously\nweakened. Leech Seed is not as useful as in newer generations, due to it\nonly draining 1/16 HP, but the HP healed against Chansey is still\nsignificant. Leech Seed and Rest is a gimmicky combination but can\nsometimes work out, especially when your opponent is lacking in\noffensive options. Reflect is another defensive move in Exeggutor's\nmovepool, as it helps it sponge hits from powerful physical attackers,\nsuch as Tauros and Snorlax. Reflect can also be used alongside Rest, but\nthis strategy works better on Hypno due to its lack of a weakness to\nIce-type moves. In general, the moves that scare Exeggutor out come from\nthe special side, except for Zapdos's Drill Peck, so Reflect is\ngenerally a poor move on Exeggutor. Finally, Egg Bomb is a similar move\nto Double-Edge, but it is not recommended due to its low accuracy.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Exeggutor's counters can be arranged into two main groups: the three\nRecover users (Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie), and other Pokemon that\ncan hit Exeggutor hard with super effective moves, such as Jynx, Lapras,\nand Zapdos. However, note that none of these are sure-fire counters, as\nExeggutor can put one to sleep with Sleep Powder, and use Explosion on\nanother. It's a good idea to send one Pokemon in first to bait the sleep\nmove to activate Sleep Clause. Good examples for this role are Alakazam,\nStarmie, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Gengar as long as you are careful to not\nswitch into Psychic. However, keep in mind that letting your sleeper get\nput to sleep could mean that you won't be able to put anything to sleep\nin the future, unless you have another Pokemon able to induce said\nstatus. Alakazam and Chansey make great counters because they can easily\nshrug off any damage from Exeggutor's Psychic with Recover and\nSoft-Boiled, respectively. Alakazam can also set up Reflect to avoid\nbeing OHKOed by Explosion, but should watch out for Double-Edge when\nswitching in if it is paralyzed. Chansey is a riskier bet because it is\ngenerally more valuable than Alakazam, and you don't want to expose it\nto the threat of Explosion, but it can easily sponge Exeggutor's Psychic\nnonetheless. Starmie works similarly, and can outspeed Exeggutor and\n3HKO it with Blizzard, but it hates paralysis and should also watch out\nfor Mega Drain.</p>\n<p>Jynx is probably the best Exeggutor counter, however. Jynx resists\nExeggutor's Psychic and can scare it with a 2HKO thanks to its STAB\nBlizzard, and has the ability to outspeed Exeggutor and put it to sleep\nwith Lovely Kiss in a lead match-up. Although it is 3HKOed by\nDouble-Edge, Jynx works wonderfully against Exeggutor that lack a\nNormal-type move. Even against Double-Edge variants, Jynx can work as a\ngood check if you predict properly. If Exeggutor takes out Jynx via\nExplosion, it is not all bad news, because that will prevent Exeggutor\nfrom Exploding on other Pokemon, such as Chansey or Alakazam, that are\ngenerally more useful than Jynx. Lapras is a great Exeggutor counter\neven though it doesn't resist Psychic; thanks to its great HP stat,\nPsychic is only a 4HKO. Articuno is a less common alternative to Lapras,\nbut its STAB Blizzard is even more powerful. The other two legendary\nbirds also work well against Exeggutor; Zapdos has a chance to 2HKO\nExeggutor with Drill Peck, while Moltres's Fire Blast will always 2HKO\nit. Cloyster can also 2HKO Exeggutor with Blizzard, but takes over 40%\nfrom Psychic. If you have no better option, your own Exeggutor can also\nwork as a check, being able to take many Psychics, wear it down with\nPsychic or Double-Edge, or threaten it with Explosion or a status move.</p>\n<p>While Gengar, Golem, and Rhydon have no business taking on Exeggutor as\nthey are countered by it, they are useful for switching into a predicted\nExplosion. However, because Exeggutor can hit them very hard with its\nother moves, doing this is very risky if you don't predict correctly. A\nlow health or sleeping Pokemon can be a good alternative to those three\nfor switching into an Exeggutor that might use Explosion.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous.\nAmnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum\n999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its\nSTAB Surf at +6. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some\nsignificant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As\nsaid, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6.\nThe same can be said about Starmie, although a base 999 Special STAB\nSurf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a\nproblem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio.\nBeating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with\nSurf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros.\nSnorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO;\na +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia\nboosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will\nfall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only\nuse Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting\neither twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations\nhave been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so\nthey may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the\nsituation of the battle itself.</p>\n<p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea.\nSlowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so\nparalyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster\nthan it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro\nswitch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave\nwill have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost\nbefore they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to\nswitch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to\nmove two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you\ncan maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to\nscore a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey\nparalyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave\nyourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an\nunparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just\nkeep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and\nthey get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also\nattempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p>\n<p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro\ngenerally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can\nkeep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special,\nno special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit,\nand due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical\nweaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side\nwithout Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam\nand Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past\nRest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating\nSlowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to\nresort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of\nbeing able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the\ntime, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by\neven a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate\nSlowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health\nSlowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already\nmentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only\nhit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it\nto Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough\nto let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian,\nto revenge kill it safely.</p>\n<p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change\nthe general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some\nway, and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of\nThunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you\ncan paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro.\nOther specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and\nElectric-types, will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze\nthem; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit\nThunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis.\nLastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a\nSlowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic.\nLetting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's\npacking Wrap.</p>\n<p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost\nensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to\ntake Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a\nlot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat\nSlowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions,\nwhich is one of the most common and &quot;safe&quot; ways of getting rid of\nSlowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40%\ndamage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to\nthe point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent,\ninvolves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and\nwell-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as\nTobybro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and\nefficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best\nstat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages.\nIt quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main\ndefensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best\nphysical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up\nfor its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.\nHowever, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires\nsome luck, which are the reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon.\nWithout setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't\nRecover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks\nExplosion or a sleep move unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the\nother hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch back, so the\nuser is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get\npast a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB\nThunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO\noutright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later\ngenerations, it's not really &quot;bad luck&quot; when Slowbro ultimately ends up\ndying to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also\nbe applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs,\nletting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that\nSlowbro depends quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of\nskill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first\ngeneration, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a\n30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is\nconcerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a\nsuper effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are\neffective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as\nwell as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia\nboosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam in particular will have the\nopportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it.\nPsychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery\nmoves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also\nrequire more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your\nopponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full\nparalysis. Having 8 less PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro\nwar.</p>\n<p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside\nis hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including\nExeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor,\nOHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use\nExplosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is\n2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's\nfreeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference\nagainst another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should\nonly be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to\n2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with\nthe difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two\nturns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to\nbe more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall\nother Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins\nlike Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and\nscare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any\nother uses other than these though, because Slowbro generally only takes\nphysical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a\nfunny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro\nfor some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro\nunless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is\nnever seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling\nSlowbro. Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed\ncritical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like\nswitching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a\nboosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO\nSlowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p>\n<p>Apart from these, Slowbro has no safe counters. Thunderbolt users are\npossible choices; the higher their critical hit ratio and amount of\nturns they can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better counters they are.\nStarmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high\ncritical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's\nnot a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't\nlike having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too,\nhaving a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around\n50% damage when it's about to die. However, it doesn't resist Surf and\nis weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB\nin their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their\nThunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high\ncritical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike\nGengar, can't Explode. Regarding Explosion, it makes a very viable\nchoice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. It won't\nOHKO a healthy Slowbro, but could put it in the KO range of Tauros's\nHyper Beam or Rhydon or Golem's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion\ninclude Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although\nGengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is\npretty much a dead Slowbro.</p>\n<p>Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost\nguaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are\nat +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on\nwho goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing\nThunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after\nboth have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a\nsurprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in\nwhen Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB\nEarthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a\ncritical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it\noff with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty\nmuch forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much\nsmaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO,\nand has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance,\nif Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moved last\non the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with\nonly Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be\ncareful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent\nin when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise die to\npreviously-boosted Surfs more often than not.</p>\n<p>If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with\nphysical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice\nat least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed\nThunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow\nones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit\nrate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely\nthat Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially\nStarmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until\nSlowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use\nThunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover\noutlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon\nthat should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's\nResting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of\ntactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and\nJynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro,\nbut will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch\nout, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p>\n",

However, its\nmost rewarding use is shrugging off the attacks Chansey fires at Snorlax\nwhen switching into her and waking up against her, thus letting Snorlax\ncome into Chansey more comfortably. Reflect is commonly used in this\nset, and protects Snorlax from physical sweepers such as opposing\nSnorlax, Rhydon, Golem, and even Tauros while sleeping; it also halves\nthe damage from Explosion.</p>\n<p>Using both Reflect and Amnesia in the same set is another possible\ncombination. After setting up, only a high number of critical hits or\ndouble Explosions will beat a Snorlax with this set, so with some\nparalysis support and residual damage, it's very difficult for the\nopponent to take him down. However, depending on the damaging move you\nchoose, there will always be something you will have difficulty getting\npast. Body Slam is preferable because it beats Chansey with regularity.</p>\n<p>Counter is rarely seen on Snorlax, but can be effective for match-ups\nwith Tauros or Snorlax, and for coming into predicted Hyper Beams from\nthem. However, using it means dropping Hyper Beam, which will limit\nSnorlax's offensive power. Thunderbolt and Thunder will hit Cloyster\nharder, making them viable options if Wrap and similar moves are\nallowed.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Snorlax is probably the second most difficult to wall Pokemon in OU\nafter Tauros. Cloyster is probably the safest Snorlax switch-in. If you\ncan paralyze Snorlax beforehand, Rest Cloyster will comfortably keep\nusing Rest against Snorlax. However, Cloyster is 3HKOed by Thunderbolt\nand 2HKOed Thunder, but these moves are almost never seen on Snorlax,\nexcept on the Amnesia set. Lapras's and Articuno's physical bulkiness\nare slightly smaller, but with Rest, they are also usually able to wall\na paralyzed Snorlax. Slowbro has the ability to set up on Snorlax and\ncan take Body Slams well. Golem and Rhydon can easily switch into a Body\nSlam, although paralysis will cripple them. These Rock-types will at\nleast ensure Snorlax is not using Body Slam again, so you can switch out\nto a Pokemon such as Lapras or Exeggutor if you fear Surf. However, if\nSnorlax is indeed packing Surf, prediction is necessary if you want to\nuse the Rock-type Pokemon. If Snorlax is using Surf over Earthquake,\nthough, Gengar will easily be able to take on Snorlax.</p>\n<p>Paralysis will cripple Snorlax in general, making him easier to wall,\nbut Chansey and Alakazam, the most common users of paralyzing moves,\ncan't switch into Snorlax. However, if Snorlax switches into any of\nthese Pokemon, staying in to paralyze him is advisable if their health\nis high. However, Alakazam can still set up Reflect and will usually win\nthe match-up or force Snorlax out due to his low critical hit rate. If\nyour opponent surprises you with an Amnesia set, your best bet is\nusually using Explosion or Self-Destruct on it with Pokemon such as\nExeggutor, Golem, Gengar, or even your own Snorlax, unless you think you\ncan take it down with, for example, Tauros or Snorlax before he can set\nup.</p>\n",

Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if\nArticuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will\nalways 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body\nSlam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it\nfind itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against\nTauros, who needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is\ntypically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as\nthey don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a\nfreeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras is the best\nArticuno counter, as it 4x resists Blizzard. Once it's in, it can wear\ndown Articuno with repeated Thunderbolts or Body Slams or, if it has a\nfree turn, use Confuse Ray on a switch-in. Everything about Starmie\nmakes Articuno's life difficult. It 2x resists Blizzard and can attack\nwith repeated Thunderbolts, paralyze either Articuno or the switch-in\nwith Thunder Wave (except for Rhydon and Golem, who have no business\nfacing a Starmie anyway), and then use any free turns to Recover.\nCloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk,\nallowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be\nrunning, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp,\nBlizzard, or Explosion. Chansey is as good a special wall as ever,\nparalyzing Articuno while firing off Thunderbolts or recovering with\nSoft-Boiled, but it should be healthy and preferably paralyzed to block a\nfreeze. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little\nhope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low.\nAlakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam\nPsychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard,\nproviding it with little time to do all of these things. Finally,\nSlowbro is a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one\nbecause it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not\nrecommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even\nhas a chance to move.</p>\n",

However, getting a Substitute up is not as game-breaking\nas it might seem, as Substitute does not block status moves such as\nThunder Wave and Sleep Powder in RBY, and almost all Pokemon, including\nChansey, can break Tauros's Substitutes in one shot.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Tauros is the most dangerous and threatening Pokemon in OU, and there is\nvery little that can counter him. Some Water- or Ice-types, such as\nLapras, Slowbro, Articuno, and especially Cloyster, are bulky enough to\ntake a few hits, but they need to be at maximum health or a critical hit\nBody Slam could put them into the KO range of Hyper Beam. If healthy,\nExeggutor and Starmie can try to switch into Tauros and threaten him\nwith paralysis-inducing moves. Exeggutor in particular is decently\nbulky, while Starmie is one of the few Pokemon able to outspeed Tauros,\nbut it's more fragile and risks being paralyzed by Body Slam. Snorlax\nmakes a semi-reliable Tauros check, as Snorlax can deal good damage to\nalmost anything that switches in, forcing Tauros to stay in. Snorlax can\nalso use Counter to deal upwards of 80% to Tauros, though Hyper Beam\nwill hurt. Zapdos can threaten Tauros with Thunder Wave and STAB\nThunderbolt, which will cripple Tauros before going down if forced to\nstay in, or even if Tauros wins that match-up.</p>\n<p>Chansey and Alakazam have no business switching into Tauros, but they\ncan threaten him with Thunder Wave. In fact, despite the high amounts of\ndamage they will take from Body Slam, it is highly recommended they stay\nin for the Thunder Wave, as a paralyzed Tauros is a lot easier to\nhandle. Alakazam can also outspeed Tauros and hit it hard with STAB\nPsychic, so that can be another way to deal with him. Packing Counter on\nChansey is another way to deal with Tauros, as she always OHKOs Tauros\nif she Counters a Body Slam. Like Snorlax, however, countering a Hyper\nBeam will be tough, as it can possibly OHKO her. Golem, Rhydon, and\nGengar can come into a predicted Body Slam; while they are 2HKOed by\nBlizzard or Earthquake, they might be able to bait a resisted move for a\nWater-type Pokemon or Exeggutor to switch into.</p>\n<p>Because most of Tauros's checks require full health when trying to\nswitch in, sometimes there will be nothing on your team that can take a\nBody Slam. When playing against Tauros, you should be prepared to let a\nweakened Pokemon die, as sacrificing the least relevant Pokemon lets you\nswitch in another one safely. In fact, you might find that your own\nTauros is the most reliable answer to your opponent's. You have probably\nkept your Tauros healthy for the late-game as well, and as such, it\nmight happen to be your only Pokemon that stands a chance against the\nfoe's Tauros.</p>\n",

Arbok,\nbarring critical hits, is going to do about 3% damage each turn with\nWrap, so it is going to take a long time to get anything into a low\nenough HP range to be KOed by Hyper Beam or Earthquake. Since neither\nmove receives STAB, you will never do much more than 30% with Hyper Beam\nand probably not much more than 40-50% with Earthquake if it's super\neffective. Your opponent is also likely to keep switching between\nPokemon in an attempt to make you miss, and you will be locked into Wrap\nuntil you miss while they do this. Arbok is pretty fast for a UU\nPokemon, so if you miss on a Pokemon that is not faster, such as\nTangela, you can fairly safely Wrap again. You are going to need to get\nmost things to lower than 30% to KO with Hyper Beam, so if you miss on\nsomething faster, you should switch and not risk losing Arbok. You can\nuse Arbok to your advantage to switch in another Pokemon if turn after\nturn they do not switch out a Pokemon, because they will not be able to\nattack if your Wrap would have continued. Using this opportunity to\nswitch in a sweeper is a great idea. If they are repeatedly switching\nbetween just two Pokemon, you can once again switch to your advantage.\nArbok does not have much in the way of STAB, although Poison would only\nreally hurt Bug- and Grass-types, and most UU Grass-types and some\nBug-types are part Poison anyway.

          "description": "<p>Ice Beam is Chansey's main attacking move. Without it, Golem and Rhydon\nwould be able to switch in for free, and Chansey would have no chance of\nscoring a freeze, for example, against opposing Chansey. Soft-Boiled is\na must as well, as it allows Chansey to repeatedly sponge attacks and\nrecover HP when necessary. Keeping Chansey at high health whenever\npossible is recommended, as this lets it paralyze Snorlax or Tauros\nbefore having to switch out. Thunder Wave is mostly useful for crippling\nsweepers such as Tauros, Snorlax, Zapdos, and Persian, and often deters\nthem from switching in. Due to the importance of paralysis in RBY,\nThunder Wave is an excellent move against anything except maybe other\nChansey.</p>\n<p>For the last slot, there are two main options. Thunderbolt is the\nrecommended move as it allows Chansey to hit Water-types such as\nStarmie, Lapras, Slowbro, and Cloyster for super effective damage while\nnabbing a fairly strong hit on Jynx. Without Thunderbolt, these Pokemon,\nespecially Starmie, can stay in on Chansey and go for the freeze with\nBlizzard or Ice Beam. While Thunder Wave will still cripple them and\nstill act as a deterrent, Chansey would be setup bait for Slowbro. While\nnot as common, Counter is a viable alternative as well; it will often\nsurprise Normal-type sweepers, such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Persian,\nthat try to capitalize on Chansey's weak Defense. Due to Chansey's\ntitanic HP, Counter will always OHKO Snorlax and Tauros using Body Slam.\nIt should be noted, however, that some players like to check for Counter\nfirst by either using Earthquake or switching back to their own Chansey.\nCounter can also be used for punishing a predicted Hyper Beam. However,\nto do this, Chansey needs to be at full health, as a STAB Hyper Beam can\ndeal around 75% damage.</p>\n<p>One could also drop Thunder Wave instead of Thunderbolt in order to use\nCounter. However, note that Counter does not fully cover physical\nsweepers; Tauros and Snorlax can still use Earthquake, which, in\nconjunction with full paralysis or a well-timed Hyper Beam, will beat\nChansey easily. Replacing Thunder Wave for Counter will also limit\nChansey against Zapdos, Slowbro, and users of partial trapping moves.</p>\n<p>Chansey can only beat opposing Chansey with Ice Beam's freeze chance;\nthe same applies to special attackers such as Starmie and Jynx. Because\nparalysis grants immunity to freeze, a common strategy consists of not\nparalyzing Chansey and fishing for the freeze instead. However, this is\nrisky as, if a freeze war occurs, both players will have a 50% chance of\nscoring the freeze, and the user of the frozen Chansey will be\nsignificantly handicapped for the rest of the battle. Chansey's\nexploitable Defense makes a more offensive approach a viable\nalternative, and is, of course, the path to take should you accidentally\nparalyze it. Powerful physical sweepers should be your main options\nhere; examples include Rhydon, Golem, and especially Snorlax. Tauros is\nnot a recommended pick, however, as its potential to make an impressive\nlate-game impact would be severely reduced if it were to get paralyzed.\nIf looking to apply this strategy, one should first paralyze Chansey.</p>\n<p>When taking the offensive approach, note that even though Snorlax is\nbulky enough to take hits from Chansey, unless you can predict Chansey\nswitch-ins with regularity, Snorlax could get worn down on the switch\nbefore making an impact if it is struggling getting past bulky Pokemon\nsuch as Rhydon, Golem, Exeggutor, Lapras, and especially Cloyster.\nMeanwhile, Rhydon and Golem will need to get past Exeggutor and Starmie,\nand a healthy Chansey can afford to take a hit and retaliate with Ice\nBeam. For this reason, you should be aware that paralyzing Chansey will\ngive your opponent the edge in stall wars, and if your physical sweepers\nstruggle getting past physically bulky and healthy defensive cores, they\nmight get worn down eventually. Nonetheless, there are other Pokemon\nthat will benefit from a paralyzed Chansey, such as Slowbro, Zapdos, and\nJolteon, and Dragonite and Cloyster as well if partial trapping moves\nare not banned. Paralysis is also the way to go if your team does not\npack Chansey.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey completely shapes the RBY OU metagame, and is an automatic\naddition to most OU teams. Thanks to its 703 HP, 308 Special, and access\nto Soft-Boiled, there is no special move that can get past Chansey\nwithout taking into account stat modifiers. For reference, the most\npowerful special move in RBY, Articuno's Blizzard, only deals a maximum\ndamage of 25%. This allows Chansey to sponge moves from specially based\nthreats such as Starmie, Lapras, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jynx, and opposing\nChansey. In addition, because direct paralyzing moves such as Thunder\nWave or Stun Spore mostly come from specially based Pokemon, Chansey\nmakes the best paralysis absorber in the game, as it is potentially able\nto neutralize other paralyzing attempts against your team once it has\nbeen paralyzed. Moreover, paralysis protects Chansey from getting frozen\nwhile not adversely affecting its special walling capabilities.</p>\n<p>However, while Chansey shines on the specially defensive side, its lack\nof STAB and mediocre, Persian-level physical bulk prevent it from being\ncompletely dominant. Specially based Explosion users, such as Exeggutor,\nGengar, and Cloyster, can take out Chansey; powerful physical sweepers,\nsuch as Snorlax, Tauros, Rhydon, and Golem, can also prey on its low\nDefense. However, Chansey can still get past these threats with the\nright move. For example, it outspeeds and 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem with\nIce Beam as long as it isn't paralyzed, and cripples physical attackers\nsuch as Tauros and Snorlax with Thunder Wave. Additionally, it can even\nrun Counter or Reflect to surprise said physical sweepers.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Reflect works as an alternative to Counter and helps against physical\nsweepers as well. It is not as game-breaking as Counter, but it doesn't\ncompletely rely on the element of surprise and works against all\nphysical attacks, including Earthquake from Golem and Rhydon, as opposed\nto Counter, which in RBY only works against Normal- and Fighting-type\nattacks. Reflect is especially useful against slow physical sweepers\nsuch as Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon due to their low critical hit rate;\nit also helps Chansey soak up Explosion from special attackers such as\nExeggutor and Gengar. Reflect Chansey will often lead to stall plays,\nmuch like Reflect Alakazam does. However, Reflect is much more common on\nAlakazam as it's faster and has greater freedom with its moveslots; with\nReflect, Chansey has to drop Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave, which limits\nit against Water-types or reduces its ability to cripple sweepers,\nrespectively.</p>\n<p>Sing is another move Chansey can use effectively, but it's uncommon due\nto its poor accuracy and Thunderbolt's predominance in the last slot.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, though, as Sing Chansey is\nunexpected and could let you score a more rewarding sleep against\nopposing Chansey or Snorlax, for instance. Combined with Counter, Sing\nmakes up for a very high-risk, high-reward combination. To pull off this\nstrategy, you need to switch a healthy Chansey into Hyper Beam from the\nlikes of Snorlax or Tauros, put the Hyper Beam user to sleep, and then\nCounter whatever your opponent switches in for an OHKO. However, this\nstrategy has many flaws that limit its effectiveness. First, Sing will\nmiss almost half the time, and if it does, you will be left with a\nChansey in the KO range of the physical sweeper's Body Slam. In\naddition, Chansey will have to drop both Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave,\nwhich will severely limit it. Finally, as Hyper Beam is most commonly\nused mid- or late-game, it's very likely that Sleep Clause will have\nalready been activated.</p>\n<p>While Blizzard is the preferred Ice-type move for most Pokemon, Ice Beam\nis recommended on Chansey, as the extra PP can make a difference in a\nfreeze war or a stall war. Nonetheless, Blizzard's extra power can come\nin handy for wearing down Snorlax on the switch in a bit more quickly,\nas well as for nabbing the 3HKO on Tauros and the OHKO on Dragonite.</p>\n<p>Other gimmicky options for the last slot include Light Screen, Flash,\nSeismic Toss, and Defense Curl; however, it's advised to stick to the\noptions previously mentioned. The former will allow Chansey to\ncompletely wall Slowbro, while the next two help it deal with Alakazam.\nDefense Curl works a bit like Reflect, but has more PP and provides\nboosts that can be stacked. Reflect is overall the best choice for\ndoubling Chansey's Defense in one turn, though.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Due to Chansey's limited offensive power, opposing Chansey and Alakazam\ncan both easily neutralize her attacks thanks to Soft-Boiled and\nRecover, respectively. However, these two cannot recover from a possible\nIce Beam freeze. Chansey can fight back with her own Ice Beam in hopes\nof scoring the freeze first, but keep in mind that paralysis grants\nimmunity to freeze, giving a paralyzed Chansey the edge in the Chansey\nwar. Meanwhile, Alakazam can use STAB Psychic to accumulate Special\ndrops on Chansey; in conjunction with random critical hits and full\nparalysis, this will eventually force Chansey out. However, Psychic will\nrun out of PP quickly. Nevertheless, Alakazam's Recover packs 16 PP more\nthan Chansey's Soft-Boiled, so it's also possible for Alakazam to force\nChansey out by PP stalling, but that increases Chansey's chances to\nfreeze Alakazam if the latter isn't paralyzed. In any case, Chansey can\nswitch back into Alakazam whenever it wants after switching out to\nremove Special drops or avoid wasting PP.</p>\n<p>Chansey can also be dealt with offensively by using strong physical\nattacks. Snorlax is bulky enough to take some hits and can reply with a\npowerful STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam, eventually beating Chansey unless\nit gets really lucky. If things get bad, Snorlax's Self-Destruct is\npowerful enough to OHKO Chansey. Rest Snorlax is especially useful when\nfighting Chansey, as Rest lets it shrug off paralysis. However, one will\nhave to watch out for threatening sweepers, such as Tauros and Zapdos,\nswitching into it while it is asleep. Rhydon and Golem can switch into\nThunder Wave or Thunderbolt and outspeed a paralyzed Chansey. Rhydon's\nEarthquake will always 2HKO Chansey, and Golem, while not as powerful,\ncan 2HKO with Earthquake and also has access to Explosion to OHKO in\ndire circumstances. These two should watch out for Ice Beam, though, as\nthey take around 60% damage from it. Tauros and Persian hate paralysis,\nbut they can also capitalize on Chansey's weak Defense with their\npowerful STAB Normal-type moves. Persian generally needs Chansey to be\nparalyzed to stand a chance, but if it is, Persian will usually win the\nmatch-up, even if Chansey paralyzes Persian in return. In any case, it's\nnot recommended to switch Tauros or Persian directly into Chansey due to\nthe threat of Thunder Wave. Zapdos and Jolteon can hit Chansey hard with\nDrill Peck and Double Kick, respectively. Jolteon can take hits from\nChansey well, but much like Tauros and Persian, it hates paralysis.\nCloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel can potentially get past Chansey\nwith their partial trapping moves, especially the latter two, but they\nrely on luck to do so. Exeggutor, Cloyster, Gengar, Snorlax, and Golem\ncan use Explosion against Chansey; Gengar's Explosion is weaker, though,\nand won't OHKO a healthy Chansey.</p>\n<p>Some physical sweeping attempts can be stopped if Chansey packs Counter\nor Reflect, however. Counter is especially dangerous as it might take\nout your Snorlax or Tauros. Reflect's ability to halve damage from\nphysical hits will often lead to stall plays, as it can protect Chansey\nfrom physical sweepers and Explosion, but it will not make a difference\nagainst Persian, who will always score a critical hit with Slash.\nHowever, if Chansey forgoes Thunderbolt, Water-types can take it on.\nStarmie could neutralize Chansey and fish for a Blizzard freeze, while\nSlowbro can easily set up with Amnesia. Lapras and Cloyster are immune\nto freeze and take almost no damage from Chansey's only attacking move,\nIce Beam. If Chansey decides to go without Thunder Wave instead, it\nwould no longer be able to spread paralysis, and fast sweepers such as\nTauros, Persian, Zapdos and Jolteon would now be able to take it on more\neasily. Moreover, the lack of Thunder Wave also limits Chansey against\nSlowbro and users of partial trapping moves.</p>\n",

Agility can be a good choice despite Jolteon's insane Speed, just because it will allow Jolteon to get its Speed back while paralyzed.

Unfortunately, Mimicking Earthquake won't save Jolteon against any Ground-type but it might be useful against some other Pokemon. Tail Whip is an option since it could force switches from Alakazam or Chansey to another Pokemon that Jolteon can paralyze, besides giving Jolteon a slightly better chance of beating Chansey in one-on-one.

          "description": "<p>Alakazam is kind of a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; Pokemon. Often, it's used in\nthe lead position with the mere objective to take sleep. In part,\nbecause common sleepers have no other way around Alakazam; in part, due\nto its ability to wake up late in the game in some scenarios. While\nothers would argue about Chansey instead, Alakazam is actually the\nPokemon that most gears RBY towards stall. While it doesn't accomplish\nmuch against opposing Alakazam, Chansey, or Starmie, they can't do much\nback either apart from a freeze from Starmie or Chansey. Thunder Wave,\nhowever, often acts as a deterrent for Starmie, who due to its different\ndefensive uses, generally hates getting paralyzed much more than\nAlakazam does. In addition, Psychic's ability to force Chansey out after\na couple of Special drops may let Alakazam paralyze or hurt whatever\nswitches in, or at least give the user the possibility to change\nmomentum by going on the offensive with a physical sweeper such as\nRhydon or Snorlax against a weakened Chansey. However, Psychic's low PP\nmeans that Alakazam will risk running out of Psychics if abusing this\nstrategy. Nonetheless, Alakazam is still capable of stalling Chansey out\nof PP one-on-one, assuming that Alakazam hasn't used much of its own PP\nbeforehand. For this reason, Alakazam often works as a backup defensive\nalternative to your own Chansey when it comes to taking on opposing\nChansey.</p>\n<p>Alakazam shares with Chansey some of its walling capabilities. Alakazam\nworks as a great wall to Exeggutor, and while not as effective as\nChansey, Alakazam also makes for a good answer to other specially based\nPokemon such as Lapras and Jynx, thanks to its great Special and Speed\nstats. Alakazam is also a great Gengar counter due to Psychic's ability\nto 2HKO it, and maybe even OHKO with a critical hit, and Alakazam is one\nof the few Pokemon able to outspeed Gengar. Alakazam's main advantage\nover Chansey comes from its powerful STAB Psychic, which will at least\n3HKO any physical sweeper brave enough to switch into or take on\nAlakazam.</p>\n<p>A common fourth move for Alakazam is Reflect. Due to its extremely low\nphysical defensive prowess, your opponent can capitalize on a paralyzed\nAlakazam by switching into a predicted Recover or even Seismic Toss.\nUnless Alakazam is totally healthy, Snorlax and Tauros can both threaten\nit with a KO from Hyper Beam, and Rhydon and Golem can also switch into\na Thunder Wave and hit Alakazam for around 70% damage with Earthquake.\nWhen Alakazam uses Reflect, these Pokemon become reliant on critical\nhits or Self-Destruct/Explosion to faint it. Of course, Reflect won't be\nup when you are switching Alakazam in and your opponent predicts on that\nturn, but it's great when you are in stall wars against Chansey, who can\nparalyze Alakazam and set up a physical sweeper switch-in. In this\nsense, Reflect not only works defensively, but also offensively, as it\nlimits the ways your opponent has to deal with Alakazam, forcing him or\nher to deal with it by using stall tactics and stall Pokemon. Thanks to\nPsychic, forcing these kind of plays may let the user spread more\nparalysis or set up offensive switches into enemy Chansey. Reflect can\nalso halve the damage of Explosion, and although they will still almost\nOHKO Alakazam, the ability to survive Exeggutor's Explosion is\nnoteworthy, as Exeggutor has generally no other way around Alakazam.</p>\n<p>The other common option for the last slot is Seismic Toss. It exposes\nAlakazam's weak defense, consequently limiting its effectiveness on\nstall match-ups in the long run as explained above, but has some\nadvantages nonetheless. While Alakazam and Starmie can both easily\nswitch in and deal with non-Seismic Toss Alakazam, especially if they\nare packing Seismic Toss and Surf, respectively, Seismic Toss on your\nown Alakazam makes doing this a very risky proposition for your\nopponent. Seismic Toss almost 3HKOes opposing Alakazam, making the KO\npossible after two or three turns of full paralysis. A bit of luck is\nrequired to pull off the kill, but Seismic Toss is often just enough to\nannoy an opposing Alakazam and make it switch out, and the same can\ngenerally be said against Starmie unless Thunder Wave alone scares it\nbefore. Slowbro will have a much harder time setting up against an\nAlakazam packing Seismic Toss, which is a 4HKO. Psychic will do almost\nno damage once Slowbro has started raising its Special stat with Amnesia\nunless Alakazam scores a critical hit. In this sense, Seismic Toss on\nAlakazam limits its possible switch-ins initially to pretty much only\nChansey, because even if Alakazam's Defense is unboosted, nobody is\ngoing to switch a physical attacker from the get-go into a likely\nPsychic. In addition, the usual Psychic-resistant switches your opponent\nmay make to reset Chansey's Special or avoid being stalled out are\nsignificantly damaged by Seismic Toss. Lastly, Seismic Toss could also\ncome in handy on a lead Alakazam, hitting common sleepers such as\nExeggutor and Jynx slightly harder before they put Alakazam to sleep.</p>\n<p>Due to Alakazam's low Defense, it's especially recommended to at least\ntemporarily use some backup physically bulky Pokemon to switch into\nphysical attackers. A combination of Golem or Rhydon and one of\nExeggutor, Lapras, Slowbro, or Cloyster provides pretty good defense\nagainst Snorlax, although you could just get away with only using one of\nthem if you keep it healthy, especially with Cloyster. It should be\nnoted, however, that Golem and Rhydon alone won't do well against\nSnorlax packing Surf, and Exeggutor sometimes gets worn down in the\nearly game. Exeggutor and Starmie work well against Golem and Rhydon's\nassaults, although you will have to be careful and keep them free from\nparalysis, especially Starmie. Tauros is much harder to deal with, but\nit won't generally switch into Alakazam unless it is in a position to\nrevenge kill it with Body Slam. The bulky Water-types mentioned above\nmight have a couple of switches into it, though. Having a plan against\nSlowbro is also a good idea. Fast Thunderbolt users such as Starmie,\nGengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, and possibly Lapras work well due to their high\nchance of scoring a critical hit, which will ignore its Amnesia boosts.\nExplosions are safer bets as long as you don't get outpredicted, but\ninvolve sacrificing at least one Pokemon. Examples include the\naforementioned Exeggutor, Golem, and Cloyster as well as Snorlax.</p>\n<p>The combination of Alakazam and Chansey is known for being able to\nhandle every specially based Pokemon other than Slowbro. Alakazam is\ngenerally sent against Pokemon with threatening sleep or exploding moves\nsuch as Exeggutor and Gengar, while Chansey generally switches into more\n&quot;pure&quot; special sweepers such as Starmie and Lapras, scaring them out\nwith Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave. Alakazam and Chansey together can\nalso handle opposing Alakazam pretty well, and both Chansey and Alakazam\nserve as answers to opposing Chansey. On the other hand, Alakazam can\nalso be useful on more offensive teams lacking Chansey as it can help\ncover the threats that Chansey would otherwise cover while possibly\nspreading more paralysis to support your sweepers, despite not working\nas well defensively.</p>\n"
        }

      "overview": "<p>While often overshadowed by bulkier and more versatile special sweepers\nin the newer generations, Alakazam fulfills a very important role in\nRBY, working as an effective special wall with Recover while being able\nto put pressure on its opponents with its limited but powerful special\noffense. Access to Thunder Wave coupled with high Speed and its ability\nto force plays with a powerful STAB Psychic makes Alakazam one of the\nbest paralysis spreaders in the game. In addition to coming from a 368\nSpecial stat, Psychic also makes great use of Alakazam's high critical\nhit rate, which, along with Psychic's 30% chance to lower the Special\nstat of your opponent, makes Alakazam very difficult and tricky to deal\nwith at times; this often forces predictable and defensive plays that\nthe user may be able to capitalize on. At the very least, Psychic's\nability to force opponents out, even the number one special wall,\nChansey, should let Alakazam keep spreading the ever dominant paralysis\nas long as what switches in has not already been paralyzed.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Alakazam has a very limited movepool and it's advised to stick to the\noptions above. Kinesis is mostly useful for dealing with Chansey. It can\nmake it easier to switch in a physical sweeper after some accuracy\ndrops, and can even work as a way to reduce Chansey's chances of scoring\na freeze. Accuracy drops will disappear by just switching out, however,\nbut this switch may let Alakazam paralyze something else. Kinesis can be\nuseful in some last Pokemon scenarios as well. Counter can sometimes be\nuseful, but Psychic will still hit pretty hard against what Counter is\nmeant to hit anyway; counter can work against Seismic Toss from another\nAlakazam too, however. Mimic can give you an Ice-type move from Chansey\nor Starmie with some luck, but that's really about it. All in all,\nneither Counter or Mimic are generally worth wasting a moveslot for.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie are all able to easily sponge Alakazam's\nPsychics initially and shrug them off with Recover or Soft-Boiled.\nHowever, Alakazam and Starmie should watch out for Seismic Toss. Chansey\nand Starmie also have the possibility to go for the freeze via Ice Beam\nor Blizzard. Chansey doesn't care much about paralysis, usually making\nit the best choice. Chansey isn't scared of Seismic Toss either thanks\nto its stellar HP.</p>\n<p>However, resorting to only one of them tends to not be enough. Because\nof Psychic's ability to score a Special drop, they may eventually not be\nable to shrug off Psychics well. After two Special drops, even Chansey\nis 3HKOed by Psychic, which means that a single full paralysis could put\nChansey at risk of being KOed. For this reason, having another backup\nPokemon that can take a Psychic well is recommended. These include any\nof the Psychic-types, such as Exeggutor, Slowbro, or Jynx, apart from\nthe aforementioned Starmie and Alakazam. In addition, these Pokemon\ndon't care about paralysis as much as physical sweepers such as Snorlax\nor Tauros do. Slowbro's ability to set up Amnesia against Alakazam is\nnoteworthy. Unless Alakazam is packing Seismic Toss, it will almost\nalways be forced to switch out, if not always, thus giving Slowbro a\nfree turn to set up its Amnesia or Thunder Wave.</p>\n<p>Alakazam has, after Jynx, the lowest defensive prowess in OU. A STAB\nBody Slam from Snorlax or Tauros will usually 2HKO it, while Rhydon and\nGolem's Earthquake and Persian's Slash will do around 70%. The problem\nis, however, that Alakazam can outspeed and 3HKO all of these Pokemon\nwith Psychic, even having a chance to OHKO Golem, Rhydon, and Persian\nand almost OHKO Tauros with a critical hit. You will have to paralyze\nAlakazam in order to apply this strategy. A predicted Recover could be\nthe best moment to switch in a physical attacker, although Rhydon and\nGolem can also switch into Thunder Wave. If Alakazam is behind Reflect,\nhowever, it's extremely risky to go in offensively, because you will\npretty much always need a critical hit to succeed. Switching the\nphysical sweeper into the predicted Alakazam switch-in is required to\ndeal with Reflect Alakazam this way.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if Alakazam is becoming really tough to deal with, you can also\ntry to Explode on it. Even if Alakazam is behind Reflect, all Explosions\n(except from Gengar) will generally hit Alakazam hard enough to lower it\nto the point where any STAB non-Psychic-type attack will finish it off.\nYou will have to watch out for Alakazam switching out after the\nExplosion and recovering damage later on against Chansey or a\nPsychic-type, though. Lowering Alakazam first to around 60% or 70% is\nthe safest route to ensure the KO.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Here it is, possibly the most annoying set in all of Pokemon history.\nIt's more than just annoying, however; it's absolutely deadly if luck is\non your side. Agility boosts Dragonite's Speed above that of any\nunboosted Pokemon in the game. It then proceeds to take advantage of\nWrap's debilitating mechanics by repeatedly using the move to render any\nswitch-in unable to move, while slowly whittling away at the opposing\nPokemon's health. Wrap can even be used to immobilize Gengar, which is\nimmune to Normal-type moves, although Gengar is unlike other Wrap\nvictims in that it does not take damage while incapacitated by Wrap. It\nis, however, not easy to find a good moment to use Agility, due to the\nprevalence of Ice-type and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY. Switching\ninto the occasional sleeping or frozen Pokemon lets Dragonite set up\nAgility safely, however. Otherwise, slow Pokemon such as Golem, Rhydon,\nSnorlax, and Exeggutor that lack Stun Spore are good options to switch\nin and set up on. Taking a hit from them, however, means that Dragonite\nis now OHKOed by unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attacks.</p>\n<p>Once the opponent's Pokemon has been worn down to low enough health,\nDragonite can use one of its other two attacking moves to secure the KO.\nHyper Beam is generally the best option, as it is the strongest attack\nin Dragonite's movepool. Dragonite will usually be able to avoid Hyper\nBeam's incapacitating side effect as Wrap is meant to first put Pokemon\nin Hyper Beam's OHKO range. It lacks STAB, but comes from a base 134\nAttack stat. Surf is the preferred option in the last slot as it\nguarantees an OHKO on the Rock / Ground types Golem and Rhydon. Blizzard\ncan be used in its place to heavily damage Golem and Rhydon, but also to\ngive Dragonite its best direct attack to use against Gengar. It also\nworks as an alternative finishing move for Pokemon such as Zapdos and\nExeggutor and, unlike Hyper Beam, does not force Dragonite to recharge\nif it does not OHKO.</p>\n<p>Dragonite is generally saved for a sweep and, as such, appreciates\nsupport from teammates that can spread paralysis directly. Not only does\nparalysis make Dragonite faster than the opponent without it having to\nuse Agility, but a full paralysis might also save Dragonite if Wrap\nmisses. Alakazam, Chansey, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Zapdos are\nall Pokemon that can perform that role excellently. The former options\ncan tank hits from many threats as well, while the latter two provide\nmore offensive pressure. The choices should depend on how offensive you\nwant your team to be, although it should be noted that Alakazam and\nSlowbro are generally the best options to spread paralysis.</p>\n<p>In addition, Dragonite is able to do more than merely sweep with Wrap;\nif it gets in on a predicted switch to a slow Pokemon, such as\nExeggutor, Snorlax, or Chansey, or on a predicted Earthquake from Rhydon\nor Golem, it can use Wrap against whatever your opponent might decide to\nswitch in. Dragonite can then switch out to a counter, which is\nguaranteed to take no damage from the switch-in thanks to Wrap's\nimmobilization effect. Dragonite's ability to act as a pivot makes it a\ndecent mid-game partner for heavy-hitters such as Snorlax and Rhydon to\nlet them switch in on paralyzed foes with impunity. Moreover, as Wrap\ncan still immobilize Gengar, hard-hitters such as Snorlax, Rhydon,\nGolem, and Tauros also synergize well with Dragonite in this regard. If\nGengar switches into Wrap, you can immediately go to a powerful sweeper\nwithout taking damage thanks to Wrap's mechanics. Earthquake will\ngenerally scare Gengar out, giving Dragonite the possibility of\npunishing whatever your opponent switches in.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>It's got a wide attacking movepool. It's tied with Mew for the\nsecond-highest Base Stat Total in the game. It's the only fully-evolved\nDragon-type in RBY, a type that sounds legendary on its own and that\nresists the STAB attacks of all three starter Pokemon. It's the final\nPokemon used by Lance, the fourth member of the Elite Four. Clearly,\nDragonite was intended to be some sort of legendary behemoth, the boss\nPokemon to end all boss Pokemon, at least until the player found Mewtwo.\nHowever, in competitive usage, Dragonite is more likely to elicit groans\nand grimaces of irritation rather than the intended screams and wide\neyes of terror. This is because Dragonite's power in OU does not derive\nfrom Hyper Beam, its massive base 134 Attack, its typing, or its diverse\nSpecial movepool. Rather, it's because of an annoying little move that\nits lowly first-stage evolution, Dratini, knows from the start: Wrap.</p>\n<p>Wrap's mechanics differ drastically in RBY compared to later\ngenerations; the move has a mere 15 Base Power, but it prevents the\nopposing Pokemon from making a move while the Wrap user is locked into\nthis move for 2-5 turns. Furthermore, the immobilized opponent cannot\nattack even during the turn the Wrap user switches out, providing a safe\nentry for another Pokemon. However, unlike in other generations, the\nopponent might switch out the Pokemon that is incapacitated by Wrap.\nDragonite is the best Wrap user in RBY because it, unlike any other RBY\nWrapper, also has access to Agility to make it faster than any other\nPokemon in the game. If Dragonite gets lucky and hits all of its Wraps,\nit can totally sweep a team without the opponent even being able to\nmove. This sounds broken, and indeed, some RBY players play with bans on\nWrap and all other moves like it (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin) because of\ntheir potential. However, Dragonite might always miss a Wrap or two,\nleaving it vulnerable to getting paralyzed or shellacked by an Ice-type\nmove. It is this unreliability that prevents Dragonite from being\nconsidered a staple of RBY OU when Wrap is allowed. When Wrap is not\nallowed, Dragonite is barely worth mentioning in OU due to its lack of\nSTAB, mediocre Speed, and disastrous 4x weakness to the ubiquitous Ice\nBeam and Blizzard.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Dragonite makes good use of Thunderbolt to hit Cloyster hard and dish\nout decent damage against Lapras on the switch in, both of which can\nscare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO with Blizzard. Thunder\nWave can be useful against switch-ins that are typically difficult to\nparalyze, such as Gengar and Starmie, that Dragonite is bound to see.\nBody Slam blends damage with paralysis chance if you don't want to give\nup an attacking move for paralysis. Double-Edge is slightly stronger\nthan Body Slam at the cost of not being able to paralyze and causing\nrecoil damage. As finisher moves, both options have an advantage over\nHyper Beam by not having to recharge if the opposing Pokemon is not\nKOed; the lower Base Power makes these moves unfavorable choices,\nhowever.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Gengar is the chief check as it's immune to Wrap and takes a pittance\nfrom any of Dragonite's other options. It doesn't really accomplish much\nagainst Dragonite, though, but will generally outlast non-Blizzard\nDragonite one-on-one in a battle between unSTAB-boosted special attacks.\nPowerful Blizzard users, such as Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and, to an\nextent, Jynx, can all scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO.\nThe former three are very physically bulky and will be able to take\nseveral hits before dying, which makes it all the more likely that Wrap\nwill miss at some point. Exeggutor and especially Slowbro are also very\nbulky and can threaten Dragonite with paralysis, but apart from that,\nthey won't generally be able to handle Dragonite on their own. Chansey\nand Starmie are resilient with their instant recovery and usually carry\nIce moves that can 2HKO Dragonite. These two can also paralyze Dragonite\nwith Thunder Wave and force it to risk full paralysis in addition to\nWrap misses. Note that Dragonite can use Agility again to completely\nignore the Speed reduction from paralysis and resume being faster than\nall of your Pokemon. On the other hand, however, as full paralysis can\nalso occur in the middle of a Wrap sequence, paralysis will severely\nlimit Dragonite's potential. Its often even advised to go for the\nguaranteed paralysis with Thunder Wave instead of using an\nunSTAB-boosted Ice-type attack that will not OHKO.</p>\n<p>Any Pokemon that has enough health to take Dragonite's Hyper Beam can\nswitch in to this predicted finishing move to cripple or KO Dragonite.\nWhen the opposing Pokemon is in KO range from Hyper Beam, the Dragonite\nuser is likely to use it instead of Wrap, to avoid the possibility of an\nuntimely Wrap miss. Punishing a predicted Hyper Beam could give you the\npossibility of paralyzing or KOing Dragonite. However, proper prediction\nis required as Dragonite could continue using Wrap, which by itself\nstill has a high success rate against the weakened opponent. Pokemon\nthat resist Normal-type moves, such as Golem and Rhydon, might even be\nsurprised by Surf, which will OHKO them.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that, if given the chance, using the turn\nDragonite uses Agility to cripple it is crucial. Even if you can only\nland one move that won't do much to Dragonite, such as Body Slam or\nPsychic, it may still be very rewarding later on, as it will increase\nthe chances of any Ice-type move OHKOing Dragonite. In addition, Body\nSlam might also score paralysis, which will often ruins Dragonite's\nability to effectively sweep.</p>\n<p>If all else fails, you can try to stall it out of Wrap PP if you can\ncount carefully to 32. Wrap is very weak and locks Dragonite into Wrap\nif it chooses to stay in, regardless of whether you choose to switch or\nstay in yourself. Thus, you can repeatedly switch out to force Dragonite\nto use more turns which read &quot;Dragonite used Wrap!&quot; and that therefore\ncost PP as opposed to the &quot;Its attack continues!&quot; turns that do not use\nPP. However, if you miscount and switch out after Dragonite has used its\nlast Wrap PP, Dragonite will still be forced to use Wrap PP, but instead\nof forcing Dragonite to use Struggle, RBY glitches and rolls Wrap's PP\ncounter up to 63 to allow it to use Wrap again, thereby rendering your\nstall for naught. This strategy works much more effectively if you have\nGolem or Rhydon on your team, as otherwise you will have to sacrifice at\nleast one Pokemon before Wrap runs out of PP.</p>\n",

It is highly\nunlikely that Exeggutor would use Explosion on Jynx, but it is also\nunlikely that it will stay in and let Jynx Blizzard it, so expect\nExeggutor to switch out.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Starmie can paralyze Jynx, resists Blizzard and Psychic, and can do\nneutral damage to Jynx with Thunderbolt. However, if your Jynx manages\nto Mimic Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt when Starmie switches in, you might\nreconsider staying in. Alakazam, likewise, can paralyze Jynx, and\nresists Psychic if it manages to switch in on that. It does take\nsomewhat significant damage from Blizzard, but it still gives Jynx\nproblems. Slowbro can switch in, get Amnesia up, and resists both\nBlizzard and Psychic. Even if Jynx manages to Mimic Amnesia, Slowbro\ncompletely destroys it due to type match-ups. Chansey, although it hates\nthe chance of being frozen, takes almost no damage from Jynx's moves,\nwhile doing plenty of damage to any Jynx without Rest. Tauros and\nSnorlax will destroy any Jynx without Counter, and will certainly OHKO\nJynx with a critical hit.</p>\n",

Blizzard hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, Golem, and Rhydon for\nsuper effective damage, and is also the most powerful move of the set to\ndeal with neutral targets, such as Normal- and Psychic-types. The 10%\nfreeze chance is never a bad thing either, and might prove game-deciding\nin on one of the many times Chansey will likely switch into Starmie.\nThunderbolt, meanwhile, deals super effective damage to Water-types such\nas Starmie, Lapras, Slowbro, and Cloyster, all of which resist Blizzard.\nThunder Wave can act as a deterrent to physical or mixed attackers such\nas Tauros, Snorlax, Persian, and various Electric-types. Be careful,\nhowever, as Chansey will often switch into Starmie, and a paralyzed\nChansey could become more problematic than an unparalyzed one. Still,\nThunder Wave is a great move to have for defensive purposes.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its access to Recover and its typing, Starmie has multiple\ndefensive uses. Like Alakazam, it can be a lead sleep absorber, as it\ncan tank other moves from Exeggutor and Jynx, and also hit them before\nthey can move. Blizzard can do heavy damage to Exeggutor and, with some\nluck--namely a critical hit or a few Sleep Powder misses--can put\nStarmie in a position where it can KO Exeggutor without being put to\nsleep. Starmie doesn't fare well against Gengar though, since\nThunderbolt will 2HKO it.</p>\n<p>Starmie can also be saved for the battle in order to make use of its\ngreat defensive coverage. If a teammate has already been put to sleep,\nStarmie can neutralize Exeggutor, which will find itself forced to use\nExplosion in order to take Starmie out, --and even that will not OHKO a\nfull-health Starmie. Mega Drain Exeggutor might have a chance to KO\nparalyzed Starmie, but Exeggutor never packs Stun Spore and Mega Drain\nin the same moveset, so this only applies if Starmie has been previously\nparalyzed. Jynx will also get worn down by Starmie eventually, and will\nonly succeed if Blizzard freezes it before, which one can expect to\nhappen around one-third of the time assuming Jynx started at full\nhealth. A paralyzed Starmie is usually a hard counter to Jynx, though,\nunless Jynx is packing Seismic Toss and gets very lucky with full\nparalysis.</p>\n<p>Starmie also makes an effective check to Golem and Rhydon, as it is able\nto switch into Earthquake and Recover off the damage while scaring them\nout with a super effective Blizzard. However, note that two high-roll\nEarthquakes from Rhydon will 2HKO Starmie, while Starmie can't OHKO in\nreturn without a Water-type attack. Meanwhile, Golem has a chance to\nOHKO Starmie with Explosion; Starmie won't like the occasional paralysis\nfrom Body Slam either.</p>\n<p>Starmie is the best Cloyster counter in the game, as it outspeeds\nCloyster, 2HKOes it with Thunderbolt, resists Clamp and Blizzard, and\neven survives Explosion at full health. Cloyster can still immobilize\nStarmie to set up a switch-in without taking damage, however. Continuing\nwith Water-type Pokemon, Starmie's high-critical-hit-ratio Thunderbolt\nis known for being a pain for Slowbro. However, Starmie is not a 100%\nSlowbro counter at all, as Slowbro can paralyze Starmie with Thunder\nWave and sometimes get past it via boosted Surfs without suffering a\ndeadly critical hit. Starmie also makes a decent Lapras check, as it is\nonly 3HKOed by Lapras's Thunderbolt while being able to paralyze Lapras\nin return and deal around 33% damage to Lapras with its own Thunderbolt.\nStarmie can at least work as a pivot, so that another Pokemon, such as\nChansey, can switch into a safe Thunderbolt. Lastly, Starmie can also\nswitch into Alakazam to start a stall war, and it might even have the\nupper hand due to Blizzard's freeze chance. However, it won't like\neating a Thunder Wave, while Alakazam might not care as much about being\nparalyzed in return.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that while Starmie loses the ability to check some of\nthese Pokemon when it's paralyzed (for example, Cloyster and the\nRock-types), checking some of the other Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and\nSlowbro, involve taking the risk of being hit by a paralysis move in the\nprocess, so you should decide which Pokemon are more important to check.\nIn addition, a paralyzed Starmie loses much of its sweeping capability\neven after Chansey is gone, as well as the ability to potentially take\non or switch into physical sweepers such as Tauros in a pinch with the\nsame effectiveness.</p>\n"

Starmie's great Speed lets it outspeed every\nOU Pokemon not named Alakazam or Jolteon and provides it with one of the\nhighest critical hit ratios.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Surf and Hydro Pump are STAB options that increase Starmie's power\nagainst neutral targets such as Normal-types, Alakazam, and Jynx. Surf,\nespecially, makes Starmie an even better Golem and Rhydon check, as it\nwill OHKO them. In order to use any of these two moves, you should\nchoose between forgoing Thunder Wave's support or dropping Blizzard.\nDoing the latter means losing super effective coverage against\nExeggutor. Starmie will still be able to wall it, but Exeggutor will now\nhave plenty of time to paralyze Starmie, fish for Special falls, set up\nExplosion, or even replenish its health with Mega Drain as you while\nStarmie tries to stall it out with Recover. While Surf is the most\nconsistent and common option, Hydro Pump can 2HKO Tauros and will 3HKO\nSnorlax and Alakazam. As an example, Surf increases Starmie's chances of\nbeating Alakazam one-on-one, sometimes after Alakazam gets fully\nparalyzed twice in a row. Hydro Pump's fewer PP makes this more\ndifficult, but its ability to 3HKO Alakazam might let Starmie beat a\nparalyzed one switching into a Hydro Pump after a critical hit or a full\nparalysis without taking a Thunder Wave in the process. Surf is commonly\nused over Blizzard while Hydro Pump is usually used along with BoltBeam\nfor a more dedicated sweeper.</p>\n<p>Ice Beam is the general Ice-type alternative move to Blizzard, but it's\ngenerally an inferior choice on Starmie. Ice Beam's main selling point\nis its higher PP, which is useful for freeze wars, but Starmie can't\nstay in against Thunderbolt Chansey anyway. Although Ice Beam could\nactually be useful for Alakazam and Thunderbolt-less Chansey stall wars,\nBlizzard is usually Starmie's strongest move, so the inferior power will\noften be significant when using Ice Beam instead. Psychic is another\nattacking option sometimes used on Starmie leads to 2HKO Gengar.\nPsychic's ability to hit Victreebel super effectively is also noteworthy\nif you are planning to drop Blizzard for it. However, unlike Surf and\nHydro Pump, Psychic only hits Alakazam, Jynx, and Hypno for resisted\ndamage. Psychic's main disadvantage is arguably that it only 3HKOes\nGolem and Rhydon. Compared to Surf, Psychic has 5 less Base Power and 8\nfewer PP, but boasts a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. Hyper Beam\nis the only move in Starmie's movepool that might bother Chansey, and\nmight come in handy against Alakazam as well. Hyper Beam does 35-41% to\nit, which means that Starmie could surprise a weakened (&lt;50%) Chansey\nattempting to switch in on it. In addition, in desperate situations, a\ncritical hit Hyper Beam can do up to 80% to Chansey and sometimes OHKO\nAlakazam. Hyper Beam is a very situational move though.</p>\n<p>Starmie can learn both Reflect and Light Screen, but neither is\nparticularly useful on it. Light Screen won't prevent Chansey from\ncountering Starmie, although it can help against Slowbro. Regarding\nReflect, Starmie is going to be met with Chansey (or Alakazam) almost\nevery time it comes in. Even if the opposing physical attacker stays in,\nyou should probably just attack, because once you set up Reflect, your\nopponent will go straight away to Chansey, so you have likely just\nexchanged half a Body Slam, with its 30% paralysis chance, for 0 damage\nin return. Reflect is only useful when the opponent is only left with\nphysical sweepers, when it could admittedly make a difference.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Chansey is by far the safest Starmie counter, as it takes pitiful damage\nfrom Starmie's attacks and threatens Starmie with paralysis and a\nlikely-to-2HKO Thunderbolt, and can even use Soft-Boiled whenever\nnecessary. Chansey only has to worry about Blizzard's 10% freeze chance\n(only 9% factoring in accuracy) as it switches in, but if Chansey is\nparalyzed, Starmie becomes completely worthless against it: Chansey can\nsimply paralyze Starmie and fire off Thunderbolt until Starmie gets\nfully paralyzed or Chansey scores a winning critical hit. Alakazam can\ngenerally shrug off Starmie's attacks with Recover, but a Starmie\npacking Surf might be more problematic. Alakazam is also susceptible to\nbeing frozen but the threat of paralysis is generally enough to scare\nStarmie away; Starmie can't handle Alakazam's Seismic Tosses well\neither.</p>\n<p>The two Electric-types, Zapdos and Jolteon, can abuse Starmie's weakness\nto Electric-type attacks with their STAB Thunderbolts. Jolteon is\ngenerally a better Starmie check than Zapdos, as it can outspeed Starmie\nand isn't weak to Blizzard. Neither of the two will enjoy being\nparalyzed by Thunder Wave though. Victreebel and Venusaur can hit\nStarmie super effectively with STAB Razor Leaf, but Starmie also hits\nthem for super effective damage in return with Blizzard or Psychic, and\nStarmie is faster than both of the two Grass-types.</p>\n<p>Paralysis provides a great way to weaken Starmie and make it less\neffective, both offensively and defensively. Stun Spore Exeggutor and\nThunder Wave Slowbro will sometimes end up hitting Starmie, while Body\nSlams might paralyze it as well, depending on which Pokemon your\nopponent sends Starmie into. Exploding on Starmie with Exeggutor or\nSnorlax can work in a pinch, while Cloyster and Golem can sometimes lure\nStarmie in and Explode on it in the switch in, but this is riskier.</p>\n",
