Facade is to take advantage of Guts, making a burned Swellow a\ndefinite force to be reckoned with, while Return / Double-Edge allow\nSwellow to do damage without being statused. This set works very well in\ntandem with Medicham, as the latter takes out Rock- and Steel-types and\nresists Rock-type attacks (although it can only take one or two hits\nbefore going down, anyway). Medicham also lures out Weezing and Dusclops\nlike no other, and Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp to activate Guts\nand sweep their team, though it will probably have to switch out of\nDusclops and come back for a sweep late-game when the latter has been\nweakened sufficiently. Quick Attack can go over one of the Normal-type\nmoves for taking out users of Salac + Flail / Reversal. Hidden Power\nFighting is primarily for OHKOing Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Ground\nhits Metagross hard. Skarmory and Normal-types are hit harder by Return\nno matter which Hidden Power you choose, however. Sleep Talk can be used\nover one of the other moves, but since Facade is not boosted by sleep,\nyou are better off not using this. A simple 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe EV\nspread with a Jolly nature works best; using Adamant is not advised, as\nthis leaves Swellow outsped by Jolly Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance and\nTimid Raikou.</p>\n"

Return is better for general sweeping purposes, but\nQuick Attack works as a way of finishing off Salac Berry users and helps\nagainst Ninjask. Swellow can set up a Substitute safely if it switches\ninto something it forces out, such as Heracross or Blissey. Once you see\nwhat they switch to, you can decide if you want Swellow to attack them\nor Baton Pass your Substitute to a teammate that will survive the foe's\nhit. If Swellow gets down to low health and is ready to Endeavor, but\nyou know that the opponent will KO next turn, it can always Baton Pass\nthe Liechi Berry boost out to a sweeper to soften up their team and\nswitch in late-game to clean up. This is the advantage of Swellow's\nSpeed--it doesn't need a Salac boost to be fast enough to Endeavor\nproperly. You can just keep Swellow in the wings, threatening to\nEndeavor whatever late-game enemy is blocking a member of your team or\nsimply take out weakened enemies along the way. Swellow also doesn't\nneed to use Endeavor immediately after Substituting down to low HP.</p>\n<p>Other options for the item are Salac Berry and Petaya Berry depending on\nyour team, but Liechi is guaranteed to at least help Swellow (especially\nif you have Return). Starf is a real option, though; no boost is useless\nwhen Swellow can pass it to the appropriate team. For example, Choice\nBand Salamence is nigh-unbeatable when their counter takes 50% damage\nfrom it and can no longer OHKO with Ice Beam thanks to +2 Special\nDefense.

Wobbuffet is too slow\nto Destiny Bond on anything but Snorlax, so the main purpose would be to\nkill Dark Pokemon that are using special attacks or Ghost Pokemon using\nphysical attacks. Tickle could be used to try and weaken an enemy's\nattack, to set up an unbreakable Substitute for a Bellyzard or\nsomething. Tickle also allows Wobbuffet vs. Wobbuffet to end, and it\nends in the Tickle user's favor, just not in the way you might think.\nTickle has less PP than Safeguard, so the Tickle user will run out of PP\nfirst, and thus die to Counter with Struggle. This is actually a good\nthing, because you still get a free turn vs. a Pokemon that is\nguaranteed to do nothing, unless you have 1 HP and don't kill it.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>252 Defense, 252 Special Defense and Careful / Impish. You get better defenses this way than by adding HP. Even though you'll do slightly less damage with Counter and Mirror Coat, it's better to survive the hit and Counter than die and not Counter, and you'll still OHKO most heavy hitters, and 2HKO most of the rest.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>By definition a counter has to be able to switch in, and nothing can\nswitch in. However, notable mentions are Toxic Dugtrio / Gardevoir /\nPorygon2, as they trap the enemy Wobbuffet. An even better option is\nCalm Mind Gardevoir. Rather than simply killing Wobbuffet, the Gardevoir\nuser can sacrifice a Pokemon, come in, Trace Shadow Tag (thus trapping\nWobbuffet), and use Calm Mind 6 times. Your last move should be\nSubstitute. Kill Wobbuffet with Ice Punch, and tell your opponent good\nluck, because they'll need it to stop 6x Calm Minded Gardevoir behind a\nSubstitute. Sharpen / Agility Porygon2 works in the same manner.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Wish makes Wobbuffet even cheaper. Wobbuffet's effectiveness increases exponentially with Pokemon that can set up. An old strategy that pops up every once in a while is that Wobbuffet Encores a Shadow Ball or set up move, switch to Smeargle, use Substitute, Belly Drum, and pass to Rayquaza / Medicham. Wobbuffet can also work with Perish Trappers in 2v2. You get the automatic Mean Look, so all your partner has to do is Perish Song, and maybe Torment while Wobbuffet Encores, making it unable to hit you with any attack other than Struggle.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set is best brought out in the end-game, when most of the opponent's specially defensive Pokemon have been worn down and most users of Ice- and Fire-type attacks have been removed. Sleep Powder is what makes this set as dangerous as it is, completely invalidating a Pokemon late in the game and opening up an opportunity for Tangela to set up Sunny Day. From there, Solar Beam will hit like a wrecking ball, with Hidden Power Fire complementing it almost perfectly. It should be mentioned that Morning Sun is a viable option in the second moveslot to make the most of Tangela's bulk and sustain its sweep, especially if you already have a sleep inducer elsewhere on your team.</p>\n<p>There are many different viable EV spreads to consider when using Tangela. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is recommended, as the base 50 and base 60 Speed tiers are heavily contested, and winning the Speed tie outside of sun could be game-changing. With maximum Speed and a Modest nature, Tangela will outrun Timid Bellossom by one point, allowing Tangela to keep its power level while giving it the possibility to beat Bellossom one-on-one if the latter is partially damaged beforehand. However, with a Modest nature, Tangela is left outsped by Jolly Pupitar by two points and will be outsped by other dangerous neutral-nature base 65 Speed Pokemon like Flareon and Chimecho. Therefore, Timid is the preferred nature, giving Tangela the ability to outspeed these threats as well as Pokemon with base 70 Speed and a neutral nature like Castform, along with giving Tangela the best possible chance of beating other Tangela under the sun. A bulkier spread is also efficient and pairs best with Morning Sun. Just 24 Speed EVs are needed with a Modest nature to outpace the entire unboosted tier under the sun; the remaining EVs should be put into HP to give Tangela some bulk to ease setup. It's important to keep in mind, though, that Tangela will have almost no chance of beating Flareon regardless of EV spread outside of crippling it with Sleep Powder, and Tangela can only hope to beat Bellossom that have taken upwards of 25% damage; Tangela will otherwise fail to KO with Hidden Power Fire under the sun and Bellossom will always have a guaranteed OHKO back.</p>\n<p>There's very little that can stand in Tangela's path once the sun is up, but there are a few immediate threats that must be taken care of before successfully sweeping with Tangela, most notably including Flareon and Torkoal. Both avoid even a 4HKO from Tangela's attacks and easily OHKO in return with Flamethrower, meaning even if they are hit by Sleep Powder at full health, Tangela has almost no chance of KOing them before they wake up. These two make Diglett a very valuable teammate to employ to ensure they are removed before attempting to sweep with Tangela, but Diglett can be pretty hard to use. Other choices include Rock-types like Sudowoodo, Water-types like Dewgong, and other Pokemon to lure them in and cripple them with Toxic. Specially defensive Swalot completely walls this set, it too avoiding a 4HKO from any of Tangela's moves and easily KOing back with either Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam. Diglett again comes in handy here for taking it out, while other Ground-types like Graveler or a Psychic-type like Chimecho can be used to try to knock it out before bringing out Tangela. Finally, specially defensive Kecleon and Lickitung are only 3HKOed by Tangela's attacks, making a physically inclined partner like Hitmonchan a valuable teammate to take them out ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Spikes support will ensure that Tangela will come out on top against a myriad of other Pokemon in the tier, including Hitmonchan, Bellossom, and Venomoth, ensuring an OHKO on the latter after a layer of Spikes and getting super close after two layers on the former two. Other Pokemon that need to be weakened before bringing out Tangela include Haunter, Chimecho, Murkrow, and Pidgeot, all of which can tank any one of Tangela's moves and all of which but Pidgeot can OHKO back after a layer of Spikes.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>65/115 physical bulk is amazing on a Pokemon that resists Earthquake in the NU tier, and Tangela puts that bulk to use with this set. Between Giga Drain and Leech Seed, Tangela will usually be getting enough health back to not warrant the use of Morning Sun, but the instant recovery is useful in certain situations. Double status is a good strategy to use with Tangela in order to cripple as much of the opponent's team as possible. Stun Spore is best used if your team needs Tangela to be able to cripple offensive Pokemon like Arbok, Vigoroth, and Murkrow. Toxic is better on teams with multiple RestTalk or Protect users to stall for Toxic damage and better allow Tangela to help the team come out on top against stall cores of Sableye, Flareon, and Dewgong.</p>\n<p>Giga Drain is the recommended STAB move thanks to its passive healing; however, its PP is really low, meaning Hidden Power Grass is a good alternative that has a bonus of being slightly stronger. Leech Seed is the main option in the last slot to increase Tangela's overall longevity and spread more residual damage around the opposite team. Toxic can be used here as well, which makes Tangela much less susceptible to Grass-types save for Roselia.</p>\n<p>There's not much point to running Special Defense EVs, as Bellossom just does a specially defensive set a million times better. Some Speed can be run to allow Tangela to hit some other defensive Pokemon with Sleep Powder before they can status Tangela in return, though Tangela typically wants maximum Defense to tank attacks from the likes of Hitmonchan better. Hidden Power Fire can be used in the last slot with Giga Drain to ward off Grass-, Bug-, and Steel-types looking for an easy switch into Tangela. Tangela also has access to Reflect, which can make it nigh impregnable physically and possibly allow Tangela to turn the tides against a Flying-type switch-in such as Murkrow. Hidden Power Ice is a good offensive option if going this route to turn Tangela into a lure to open a sweep for something weak to Flying-types such as Hitmonchan. Finally, Protect is a decent option to include somewhere on this set to allow Tangela to scout the opponent's attacks, rack up passive damage, and stall for more Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery.</p>\n<p>Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to its huge Special Defense, resistance to Grass, and ability in Liquid Ooze, which turns Leech Seed into a hindrance for Tangela and its teammates. This makes Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates to have to switch into Swalot and other Poison-types to threaten them out with a STAB Earthquake. Chimecho is also a good teammate to have for this reason, and it also helps immensely with combating opposing Roselia, which can otherwise switch into this set without fear and shrug off any status with Natural Cure.</p>\n<p>In general, defensive Tangela should be used as part of a defensive core and thus needs a specially defensive teammate to work effectively for the team. Kecleon, Flareon, and Dewgong make great teammates to accomplish this and pair well with Tangela typing-wise. Dewgong is particularly effective for taking on Fire-types and can tank attacks from the common Flying-types as well if need be. Having Spikes support will increase the effectiveness of the passive damage Tangela will spread around the opposing team with Toxic and Leech Seed, and all of its moves tend to cause switches, which will rack up damage. Finally, because Tangela almost completely walls most Ground- and Rock-types, having a late-game sweeper that can take advantage of their absence is best to have along, with examples including Plusle, Pidgeot, and Raticate.</p>\n"

Offensively, Tangela and Bellossom can be considered rivals somewhat; while Tangela boasts slightly higher Speed and power and much better physical bulk to make end-game sweeping easier, Bellossom has much, much better special bulk to take better advantage of its typing against major metagame threats like Huntail and is therefore easier to fit on teams. Defensively, Tangela has few rivals when it comes to physical bulk; it's almost unmatched in its ability to wall Rock-types (outside of not resisting Explosion), and it easily checks the likes of other huge physical threats like Hitmonchan and Raticate. Regardless of whether Tangela is running an offensive or defensive set, Sleep Powder will be its ace in the hole, crippling many Pokemon in the tier. All in all, Tangela holds a very secure spot as one of the top Pokemon in the metagame.</p>\n",

A more effective set that was not included above is a SubSeed set, which Tangela can actually pull off pretty effectively with its decent Speed stat and high Defense, made even better with its low HP stat. However, defensive Tangela will tend to get more mileage out of spreading status, and a SubSeed set is even more walled by Roselia than just the defensive set.</p>\n<p>More gimmicky options include a RestTalk set, which can make Tangela very hard for opposing defensive teams to take on, but Tangela has massive four-moveslot syndrome as it is; making room for both Rest and Sleep Talk will leave Tangela completely walled by a huge number of Pokemon while not walling much more than it otherwise would in return. Tangela's Attack is pretty terrible, but it does get Endure and Flail, which can surprise a couple of its common specially defensive counters while it cannot be walled by Rock-types in return thanks to its Grass STAB. Finally, Psych Up can allow Tangela to get the jump on a Calm Mind-boosted Chimecho or Sableye, but it doesn't have much use outside of that.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Swalot, especially specially defensive RestTalk variants, is the most surefire counter to any set Tangela may be running, as it's not even 4HKOed by anything Tangela can throw at it apart from Hidden Power Psychic (which is never seen), and it isn't fazed by any status Tangela can inflict, even passively harming Tangela throwing out Giga Drain and Leech Seed with its ability Liquid Ooze. Next in line are Fire-types, particularly Flareon and Torkoal, which accomplish pretty much the same as Swalot minus packing Liquid Ooze but gaining power to their STAB moves under Sunny Day. Venomoth and Roselia are practically immune to Tangela's Grass-type STAB attacks and can put the hurt on Tangela with Hidden Power Fire, but they will take a lot of damage from Tangela's own Hidden Power Fire in return.</p>\n<p>Pidgeot and Murkrow resist Tangela's Grass-type attacks, and Murkrow is even immune to Sleep Powder, but they need to be healthy to effectively take on Tangela under the sun, as Solar Beam will still be doing a ton of damage to both. Haunter is even frailer than those Flying-types but still resists Grass and will cleanly OHKO Tangela in return, which neither Flying-type can cleanly accomplish, though Murkrow almost always will with Drill Peck if Tangela is running 0 HP EVs. Finally, Glalie doesn't resist Solar Beam and will take a ton of damage from Hidden Power Fire, but it will easily OHKO Tangela in return with Ice Beam.</p>\n",

Thief is a cool alternative and Perish Song a novel move,\nbut they are generally overshadowed by Absol's other options. In UU,\nAbsol can use Endure or Substitute and sweep with a Salac Berry boost,\nthanks to Swords Dance and its massive Attack stat.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Nearly anything. Skarmory, Weezing, and Suicune might find it hard to\nphaze Absol out due to its access to Taunt and Thunderbolt, but it will\nbe hard-pressed to do much to bulky offensive Pokemon. Metagross is a\ngood example as Absol cannot hurt it outside of a Fire-type attack,\nwhile Metagross has STAB Meteor Mash to quickly defeat Absol.

Toxic is preferred over Heal Bell as catching the likes of\nRaikou on the switch disables it from sweeping, but Heal Bell is also a\ngood option because Lapras is a relatively durable cleric. On the flip\nside though, Toxic leaves Lapras vulnerable to status itself, especially\npoison, while Heal Bell often renders it unable to inflict decent\nresidual damage. Roar is an important aspect of the set as it enables\nLapras to capitalize on forced switches, rack up Spikes damage, and also\nphaze opponents that try to set up on it.

Swampert makes a decent partner thanks to its resistances to\nRock and Steel, as well as its immunity to Electric; it can also check\nthreats to Lapras, such as Tyranitar and Metagross. Both share a\nweakness to Grass though, so be sure to pack a teammate that resists\nGrass, such as Skarmory or Salamence, which are both good Heracross\nchecks as well. Claydol makes an excellent partner to Lapras thanks to\nits ability to check Tyranitar, as well as its key resistances to Rock\nand Fighting, and its immunity to Electric.

However, it has major issues in\npractice. First of all, Lapras is outclassed by other OU Water-types,\nnotably Vaporeon (who also has Water Absorb), Milotic, and Swampert, in\nthe role of bulky Water. This is because many of the Pokemon that bulky\nWaters typically check, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, beat Lapras\none-on-one due to its irksome secondary Ice typing, which gives it many\nqualities undesirable in a bulky Water, most notably a weakness to Rock\nand a neutrality to Steel. In addition, Lapras is outclassed as a Dragon\nDance sweeper by other Pokemon with higher offensive stats, physical\nSTAB, and a better physical movepool, such as Salamence. Finally, Lapras\nis outclassed as an all-purpose special wall by the likes of Regice due\nto the fact that Lapras has two special weaknesses to common attacking\ntypes, namely Electric and Grass, and is also vulnerable to all forms of\npassive damage and status.</p>\n<p>In general, Lapras works best against teams that rely on defensive type\nsynergy and resistances, as opposed to those that rely on dedicated\nspecial walls to counter special attackers. Lapras has one major niche\nin OU: Toxic enables it stall out bulky Waters such as Milotic, and Roar\nenables it to phaze boosting Waters such as Suicune, and rack up Spikes\ndamage as well. However, note that if it lacks Roar, Lapras is a poor\nanswer to Suicune, as Suicune will then be able to Pressure stall it\nwith ease.</p>\n",

Surf is a decent\nSTAB move that provides some coverage; not only is it Lapras's best\noption against Metagross, it might allow Lapras to take Tyranitar by\nsurprise and hit it for good damage. Surf can also nail Houndoom, but\nnote that Surf forces Lapras to forgo one half of the BoltBeam\ncombination--usually Thunderbolt. There's always Hydro Pump as well, but\nthis is inferior to Surf on a tank such as Lapras due to its lower\naccuracy and PP.</p>\n<p>Sing is a good option for the Utility set as it lets Lapras put an\nunsuspecting switch-in to sleep, but its accuracy is shaky, and it\nleaves Lapras vulnerable to status and unable to wear down its counters.\nPsychic can catch Heracross off-guard, but is generally not worth it as\nit provides no notable coverage outside of Heracross. Perish Song is an\ninteresting option for an alternative phazing move that can deal with\nthreats such as the feared last-Pokemon Calm Mind Suicune; it can also\nwork decently in conjunction with Chaosbreon. Finally, Lapras can\nfunction as a decent Curse user, but it is weak to the most common\nspecial type in the game, and is easily OHKOed or 2HKOed by all STAB\nThunderbolts.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Special walls in general, such as Blissey and Snorlax, shrug off\nanything that Lapras can throw at them; Curse Snorlax can even set up on\nLapras that lack phazing utility, while Blissey can heal its teammates\nof status that Lapras has spread. Specially defensive and Light Screen\nForretress variants can use Lapras as Spikes fodder if Lapras is not\ncarrying Surf or Hydro Pump. Regice laughs at anything Lapras throws at\nit and can hit it hard with Thunderbolt. Dusclops completely walls\nLapras and can status it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, and its Pressure\nability lets it beat even RestTalk Lapras.</p>\n<p>Heracross has the Special Defense to take hits from Lapras, and can hit\nit with a super effective Fighting move. In addition to being immune to\nToxic, Metagross can also take all of Lapras's hits, then swiftly 2HKO\nit with Meteor Mash. Tyranitar needs to watch out for Surf and Toxic,\nbut once it's safely in, it can dispatch of Lapras with a powerful Rock\nSlide or set up with Substitute or Dragon Dance on a predicted switch;\nuninvested Tyranitar outspeeds Lapras by one point. Houndoom is a good\nanswer to Lapras as it is not even 3HKOed by Thunderbolt and can deal a\ngood 45% with Fire Blast. However, as with Tyranitar, it needs to be\ncautious of Surf and Toxic. Specially defensive Zapdos is a decent\nanswer to Lapras despite being hit super effectively by Ice Beam; Ice\nBeam is a 3HKO while Zapdos's Thunderbolt 2HKOes Lapras. SubCM Jirachi\nmakes an excellent Lapras counter as it can boost up to make its\nSubstitutes unbreakable, is immune to Toxic, and immediately threatens\nLapras with Thunder or Thunderbolt. SubCM Raikou is in a similar boat to\nJirachi, but needs to watch out for Toxic on the switch. Lanturn and\nMagneton both resist the BoltBeam combination and can hit Lapras for\nsuper effective damage with their STAB Electric moves.

Mawile is one of the few Pokemon with access to both Swords Dance and Baton Pass in NU, which is an incredible tool for offensive teams. At +2, dangerous physical attackers like Hitmonchan and Pidgeot become absolute wrecking balls with little to stand in their way. If you're able to pass both Substitute and Swords Dance to a teammate, there's little that can stand in the way of a victory. Alternatively, Focus Punch is a fantastic option that pairs perfectly with Substitute, allowing Mawile to dish out decently powerful hits on the Pokemon likely to switch in on it.</p>\n<p>Hidden Power Steel is a required STAB move to give Mawile a decent hit on a good portion of the metagame and makes sure it isn't a sitting duck should it be unable to get up a Substitute or Baton Pass out to a teammate. With a Swords Dance under its belt, Mawile is actually pretty threateningly strong, allowing it to attempt a sweep itself should the need be there, although this shouldn't be a main end-game goal considering Steel's poor coverage and Mawile's lackluster stats.</p>\n<p>The EV spread is highly flexible and the one given is a balanced spread to allow Mawile to do a couple different things. With 124 Speed EVs, Mawile is able to outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Whiscash and Wailord. 132 HP EVs let Mawile set up a Substitute on -1 Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and keep the Substitute intact as it passes to a teammate. This lets Mawile invest the rest of its EVs in Attack to boost the strength of Hidden Power Steel and Focus Punch. If you have no desire to use Mawile for attacking and instead want to focus on its defensive qualities, an Impish nature with max HP and 132 EVs in Defense can be run to allow Mawile to set up on even more attacks, with its Substitute notably surviving even -1 Choice Band Raticate's Double-Edge. No Speed and a Relaxed nature can be run as well to allow Mawile to underspeed as much as possible, forcing it to eat the hit of the opposing Pokemon before passing to a teammate, giving its teammate clear entry onto the battlefield. With max Defense investment, Mawile's Substitute will survive even -1 Choice Band Pidgeot's Double-Edge. Finally, no attacking moves can be run on this set, allowing Mawile to run both Swords Dance and Iron Defense on the same set, which is most commonly seen on Baton Pass chains.</p>\n<p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Wailord and Whiscash, are the best switch-ins to Mawile, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Substitute and Swords Dance and force them out are the best possible teammates, with examples including Kecleon and Hitmonchan. Ground- and Fighting-types are also common switch-ins to Mawile, making Flying-types like Pidgeot and Poison-types like Swalot good teammates too. Pelipper creates a very good defensive core with Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is abysmal and you'll need switch-ins to the special attacks aimed its way.</p>\n<p>Finally, Mawile is an essential part of Baton Pass chains, and this set is essentially the one you would use should you put it on a chain. If doing so, it's recommended to replace Hidden Power Steel with Iron Defense, as Mawile is one of the few with access to it and Baton Pass. Max HP and max Speed should be used as well.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to Intimidate and its Steel typing, Mawile is actually a fairly stout physically defensive bulwark against the myriad of Choice Band users and physical attackers in the tier, despite its average stats. This set aims to make the most of this fact, becoming an amazing defensive pivot for defensive and offensive teams alike. Even with no Attack investment, Hidden Power Steel is a good STAB move that makes use of Mawile's decent base 85 Attack and makes sure it isn't a complete sitting duck. That said, Seismic Toss provides much more consistent damage at the cost of being unable to touch Haunter. Toxic is needed as a semi-consistent damage source and heavily cripples the Choice Band attackers that Mawile so effectively checks. Protect helps scout the opponent's attacks and stalls for Leftovers recovery and Toxic damage. Baton Pass should be on the set, regardless if Mawile actually has something to pass or not, as it provides amazing momentum and scouts your opponent's switches.</p>\n<p>The EVs on this set are flexible, although max defensive investment is recommended to allow Mawile to check and counter as many Pokemon as possible. A bit more Attack can be used to beef up Hidden Power Steel a bit, or a bit more Speed can be run with Substitute over Protect to allow Mawile to, for example, set up a Substitute before getting hit by Sleep Powder or Leech Seed from defensive Bellossom and then Baton Passing to a teammate. Body Slam can be run somewhere to let Mawile spread paralysis a bit on the opponent's team, preferably over Toxic so the two statuses don't clash too much. Taunt is an interesting option to let Mawile outstall certain defensive Pokemon like Kecleon and Relicanth that would normally be able to shrug off Toxic with Rest; however, it's hard to use, as it only lasts two turns and Mawile sports no recovery of its own outside of Leftovers. Counter is a good option as well, since Mawile can tank almost any physical attack thrown its way at full health, even most super effective ones if the foe is at -1 Attack, and take out the opponent in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>Spikes paired with this set make it very dangerous, as almost all of Mawile's checks are grounded, which means Glalie and Roselia are good teammates. As this set fits well on defensive and stall teams, dedicated special walls like Lickitung make excellent teammates to cover Mawile's lower Special Defense and forming a solid defensive core. Chimecho and Pelipper in particular pair well with Mawile as they cover its Fighting and Ground weaknesses, with Pelipper also covering the Fire weakness. In return, Mawile checks the Choice Band attackers they cannot handle, like Pidgeot. Mawile also fits well on more offensive teams as a pivot to check dangerous attackers like Raticate and dry passing to teammates to keep momentum.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set is a bit unexpected and allows Mawile to hit very hard right off the bat, which can surprise the opponent and force more switches. Hidden Power Steel is a decent STAB move and is a nice safety move to use on this set. Focus Punch hits very hard, in fact\u2014it hits way harder than Hidden Power Steel on almost every target\u2014but is a bit hard to use without Substitute, and Brick Break is an all-around safer and more reliable option to use. That said, Focus Punch can OHKO Dewgong where Brick Break tops out at about 65%, so if you can predict well the power is more than worth it. Rock Slide rounds off coverage nicely and hits the Fire-types likely to switch into Mawile very hard. However, Sludge Bomb is an option as well and hits neutral targets and Tangela far harder than Rock Slide.</p>\n<p>Baton Pass is what makes this set viable and dangerous. With it, Mawile can retain momentum for its team and feign a defensive or supportive set early in the game while scouting the opponent's team. This gives Mawile a huge leg up when compared to similar Choice Band users like Lairon, and because of Mawile's tendency to switch often, it creates opportunities to surprise your opponent with a powerful Focus Punch.</p>\n<p>124 Speed EVs are run to let Mawile outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Wailord, max Attack is run to give it as much power possible, and the rest is pumped into HP to increase its overall bulk. More Speed can easily be run to outrun key threats like Dewgong, but one of Mawile's perks is its decent bulk combined with Intimidate, and having a Choice Band user that isn't threatened by a large majority of physical attackers is one of the major reasons to include it on your team. A move not mentioned above that is perfectly usable is Double-Edge\u2015a powerful safety move that can be included in the third or fourth slot\u2014but it offers no additional super effective coverage and the recoil is undesirable.</p>\n<p>Mawile tends to lure in defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Flareon with its other sets, and this set can surprise them and take them out quickly with Focus Punch and Rock Slide, respectively. Lacking Earthquake and a powerful STAB move is ultimately Mawile's downside as a Choice Band user, but when combined with one or two more heavy hitters like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, Mawile can really put the pressure on defensive and offensive teams alike, making it a decent choice for offensive teams. Pelipper creates a very good defensive backup for Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is particularly abysmal, with Kecleon being able to pull off a similar Choice Band or physical attacking set itself to continue pressuring the opponent.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Mawile is pretty unassuming at first glance, with no stellar stats to speak of; however, as its Pokedex entries state, looks can be deceiving. Mawile is actually one of the best Pokemon in NU with a lot of positive qualities to speak of, which include: a defensively fantastic pure Steel typing, a great ability in Intimidate to bolster its otherwise below-average Defense, and most importantly, access to Baton Pass and a phenomenal movepool. Thanks to these qualities, Mawile can take on several roles for teams and do them all extremely well. Most commonly, Mawile's roles are to check Normal- and Flying-types, help the team through softening physical blows with Intimidate, and support its offensive teammates by passing Swords Dance and/or Substitute to them. Common weaknesses, particularly the ubiquitous Fighting-type weakness that plagues nearly every physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, and low Special Defense and Speed stats are Mawile's downfalls. Despite this, Mawile is a fantastic choice for offensive and defensive teams alike, and most teams are only made better with its addition.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A specially defensive set is doable considering Mawile's plethora of resistances; although, its special bulk is pretty abysmal on the whole, it does at least avoid the 2HKO from Plusle's Thunderbolt at max Special Defense investment, making a RestTalk set a viable option. Speaking of, a physical RestTalk set is more than doable, but one of Mawile's major draws is its flexibility in battle thanks to Baton Pass, and a RestTalk set actively works against that. A special attacking set is a cute gimmick when paired with Fake Tears, and Mawile actually has a decent special movepool that includes Fire Blast, Crunch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Hidden Power Grass. Finally, a Substitute + Torment set could really screw over a lot of Pokemon, as most in the tier will typically only be carrying one move that threatens Mawile; however, Mawile's Speed makes this set somewhat ineffective on the whole.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>RestTalk bulky Water-types are the best immediate answers to Mawile, as they resist Steel, don't care too much about Toxic, and can hit Mawile on its lower Special Defense stat with their STAB moves. Wailord in particular is probably the best overall answer to Mawile, as it can use Roar to disrupt Mawile's Baton Passing shenanigans. Dewgong can also disrupt Baton Pass through Encore and Perish Song. Otherwise, Whiscash and Relicanth can easily 2HKO Mawile with Earthquake and shrug off Mawile's other attacks easily enough. After Water-types, Hitmonchan has a tougher time switching directly into Mawile due to its physical frailty, but once in it'll easily OHKO Mawile. Fire-types like Flareon make great switch-ins to Mawile, as they resist Steel and can easily OHKO Mawile with their Fire STAB moves, with Flareon also being able to carry Roar to disrupt Baton Pass. Tangela is physically bulky enough to not be fazed by anything Mawile can through at it apart from a rare boosted Sludge Bomb, and it can proceed to either put Mawile to sleep or blast it with Hidden Power Fire under the sun.</p>\n<p>For the most part, fully countering Mawile is difficult due to its affinity to Baton Pass out. Doing things to disrupt the momentum and making smart switches are going to do more to bring Mawile down than trying to counter it directly. Pokemon with phazing moves are the most effective answers to Mawile outside of the ones listed above, Whirlwind Tropius being an excellent answer in particular, but Roar Lairon and Piloswine making decent answers as well. Other disrupting moves like Encore, Perish Song, Leech Seed, and status moves like Thunder Wave will go a long way in taking it and its teammates down.</p>\n",

With just Double-Edge, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Ground, Raticate covers every Pokemon in the tier that it needs to, meaning the last moveslot will mostly be filler. Quick Attack is probably the most useful of Raticate's options, protecting it from getting picked off by a weakened Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and weakened weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail. Facade is another option that becomes stronger than Double-Edge without the recoil should you be able to switch Raticate into a Toxic, which also powers up Raticate's other moves thanks to Guts.</p>\n<p>A Jolly nature is needed to outpace the base 95 Speed tier, which includes dangerous threats such as Plusle and Haunter, both of which Raticate OHKOes with the appropriate move. Super Fang is a good option for the last slot to spread around damage on the opponent's team if you can support Raticate well enough to get in and out quickly, and it is Raticate's best option for wearing down Relicanth and Mawile. However, Super Fang should only be used if you can expect to be able to switch Raticate out immediately, as being locked into Super Fang can create clear setup opportunities for dangerous threats like Huntail.</p>\n<p>When playing with Raticate, do all in your power to switch it into a Toxic to activate Guts, which takes Raticate from a moderately dangerous, semi-truck of an attacker to a nuclear-warhead-attached-to-a-wrecking-ball-being-launched-off-a-rocket sweeping powerhouse. This requires playing a bit riskily and predicting your opponent heavily, but the reward is worth the risk tenfold, and when playing against stall-centric teams, where Toxic is most likely to get thrown at your team, the risk level for playing hard and fast with Raticate is usually pretty low.</p>\n<p>Haunter is immune to three of the four moves on this set, so you need to bring a decent switch-in to it when using Choice Band Raticate, preferably something very specially bulky like Flareon or Chimecho. Spikes support is exceptionally good with this set as well, as nearly every check or counter to Raticate, apart from Haunter, is grounded, making Glalie and Roselia good teammates to lead off the team with. Rock- and Steel-types easily tank even a Guts-boosted Facade, making Water- and Grass-types good offensive teammates to bring with and wallbreak for Raticate.

          "description": "<p>The idea of this set is pretty simple; get Raticate down to 1 HP and unleash hell the likes of which your opponent has never seen. The best way to accomplish this is to bring Raticate in on something that can likely OHKO it, like Hitmonchan without Mach Punch, use Substitute during the proceeding attacks or Endure the hit, and attack with Reversal from 1 HP, which after a Liechi Berry boost OHKOes even fully physically defensive Relicanth, and watch as your opponent's team just crumbles before you. This set is best used late-game so that switching Raticate in on something that will likely annihilate it doesn't look as suspicious. The choice between Substitute and Endure comes down to personal preference and your team build: if you are positive you can keep Spikes off the field or won't have to switch Raticate in on anything to eat a hit, using Substitute is probably the safer option; if you are confident in your prediction skills and don't want to have to accommodate for Rapid Spin on your team, Endure is probably the better option.</p>\n<p>Shadow Ball is needed so that Haunter, Chimecho, and Sableye don't just completely wall this set. The choice between Quick Attack and Return is tough. Quick Attack is a better option than any other STAB move apart from Return because a full-powered Reversal is nearly as strong as a full-powered Facade (which is hard to use on this set considering if Raticate is poisoned or burned, it won't be at 1 HP for long, and if it's paralyzed it's too slow to sweep anyway). Quick Attack also protects Raticate from Mach Punch and other Quick Attacks thrown its way. Return is still an option if having a strong STAB move when not at 1 HP is desired, and Return is Raticate's best option for Poison-types if you're scared of your opponent packing an Arbok or Swalot.</p>\n<p>Liechi Berry with a Jolly nature is the main option due to the fact that Raticate is the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier when Jolly, meaning a Speed boost from Salac Berry will usually be unwarranted. Salac Berry does have its use when used with an Adamant nature, as Raticate is then able to hit slightly harder when unboosted as well as outspeed Sunny Day Bellossom and Rain Dance Huntail once boosted. However, Raticate loses a ton of power without the Liechi Berry boost.</p>\n<p>Endeavor is an option on the set as well in place of Quick Attack, which can bring any one Pokemon down to 1 HP before Raticate goes down itself. This will rarely be helpful, but if you're unable to remove the opponent's Swalot, this will be Raticate's best option to help the rest of team. Taunt can be used to force the opponent into attacking Raticate and activating its Berry, which eliminates any mind games the opponent can play with you and prevents Raticate from getting hit by status, but if the opponent attacks the turn Raticate uses Taunt and OHKOes it, all will have been for naught.</p>\n<p>Physically defensive Swalot is about the only major block to this set, making Chimecho and Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates. Diglett deserves a special mention for basically ensuring Swalot is removed or at least weakened enough for Raticate to break through. Physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can tank a +1 Reversal, meaning Grass-types are good partners as well to eliminate or weaken them before sweeping. Defensive Pelipper is another good check to Raticate, making Plusle a good teammate (and Hidden Power Grass Plusle will blow past Whiscash as well). Finally, Venomoth and defensive Tangela can check this set as well, making Flareon a good teammate.</p>\n"

The only major downside to bringing Raticate is that nearly every team is going to be naturally prepared for it, whether that be through the near-omnipresence of Hitmonchan in the tier or through the presence of physically bulky checks to it like Sableye and Relicanth. Regardless, Raticate's deadliness is undeniable, and it's definitely worth consideration for building a team around.</p>\n",

However, Raticate loses a ton of power on its other moves, which may or may not be worth it, depending on your team.</p>\n<p>As a Normal-type, Raticate has quite the expansive movepool, but almost none of it is worth using due to Raticate's stats. Substitute can be used with Silk Scarf, which can help with predicting and protects Raticate from Thunder Wave. Super Fang is an option on any Raticate set, and when used with Substitute it turns Raticate into a decent stallbreaker; unfortunately, Raticate's would-be main target, Sableye, is immune to it. Finally, Thunder Wave and Toxic are options to weaken some of Raticate's main checks, including Sableye and Relicanth.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Haunter is immune to basically every one of Raticate's moves apart from Shadow Ball, meaning it'll generally have a safe switch into Raticate and at worst will be able to easily revenge kill the Choice Band set. Steel- and Rock-types resist Raticate's STAB moves and can usually tank Hidden Power Ground, even when it's Guts-boosted, although they must all be wary of the Reversal set. Hitmonchan easily OHKOes Raticate with Mach Punch, but it cannot safely switch into most of Raticate's moves. Swalot checks the Choice Band set and almost completely walls the Reversal set, but it must be wary of accidentally giving Raticate a Guts boost. Defensive Tangela can easily tank anything from either set but isn't strong enough to 2HKO in return, so be careful when using it.</p>\n",

It is a fairly safe switch-in to Metagross, Aerodactyl, and\nSalamence, can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, or be a true tank\nwith Calm Mind. However, it is inferior to standard bulky Water-types,\nnamely Milotic, Swampert, and Suicune, for a few reasons. Unlike\nSwampert, it isn't immune to sandstorm and lacks a resistance to Rock;\nunlike Milotic, it has neither Marvel Scale nor Recover, and has to rely\non Rest. Finally, Slowbro's Psychic typing renders it weak to Shadow\nBall and Crunch, the former of which is on some Metagross, while the\nlatter leaves it open to Tyranitar. All in all, while Slowbro isn't the\nbest bulky Water-type out there, it definitely has its uses.</p>\n",

Psych Up is\nhandy against opponents that boost their Speed or defenses, while Yawn\nforces switches effectively. Sleep Talk is an option on the Calm Mind\nset; it makes Slowbro an even better tank.

Simply get Huntail in, set up Rain Dance, and proceed to use Hydro Pump until you win. Ice Beam is there to keep Roselia and other Grass-types from effectively countering Huntail. The last moveslot is dedicated to dealing as much damage as possible to the tier's other Water-types. Hidden Power Grass is nice to get the OHKO on Relicanth and Whiscash, while Hidden Power Electric decimates Pelipper.</p>\n<p>The EV spread is straightforwardly offensive to make Huntail as strong and fast as possible, with maximum Speed being needed to ensure Huntail at least Speed ties with other Huntail and outspeeds base 50 Speed Pokemon outside of rain. A bulkier EV spread of 152 HP / 252 SpA / 104 Spe is certainly doable if you are unconcerned about tying with other Huntail, giving Huntail some cushion against priority attacks and weaker attacks from its counters like Dewgong. The 104 Spe EVs are kept to hit 166 Speed, which doubles to 332 in the rain, just enough to outpace +1 Pupitar. Running the above spread with a Modest nature is also an option, which will notably ensure the 2HKO against Roselia with Ice Beam. Finally, Mystic Water is an option to give Huntail's Water-type STAB attack a bit more punch, in particular opening up a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP Chimecho with Hydro Pump and a 2HKO on maximum Special Defense Lickitung with Surf.</p>\n<p>The last moveslot can be replaced if you are confident in your ability to remove Huntail's checks and counters before bringing it out. Baton Pass is the most immediate replacement option, as it gives Huntail a fantastic way out of the battlefield and keeps momentum on your team's side. Substitute can be used to protect Huntail from status from the likes of Lickitung, Togetic, and Wailord. Finally, Toxic is an option to counteract Dewgong lacking Rest as a reliable long-term answer to Huntail.</p>\n<p>Huntail is a pretty self-sufficient late-game sweeper, although there are a couple Pokemon that need to be weakened or removed before it can consider a sweep. Specially defensive Dewgong is the most pressing concern, as it is only 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass and can easily remove the damage with Rest and attack in kind with its own Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Bellossom is the other major barrier to a successful Huntail sweep, as it is only 3HKOed by Ice Beam and can regain its health with Giga Drain and Synthesis. As both of these answers, as well as most of the other Pokemon that can tank a Hydro Pump, are grounded, Spikes support is the best way to initiate a Huntail sweep. This makes Cacturne and Roselia good teammates, and both can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that are sure to be aimed at Huntail. A strong, physically attacking teammate can remove most of the Pokemon that can reliably answer Huntail, making Hitmonchan a good offensive partner. Plusle makes a fantastic offensive teammate as well, as it can remove Dewgong from the picture and weaken the other specially defensive Pokemon on your opponent's team enough for Huntail to sweep. As a bonus, Plusle gets Rain Dance and Thunder, making it a good dedicated rain setter teammate as well. Pairing Huntail with a lure like Seadra is also an option, as it can force the opponent to reveal their Water-type answer and weaken it, allowing you to best prepare for a Huntail sweep later in the game.</p>\n"

On top of this, Huntail easily OHKOes the common Fire-type leads of the tier with Hydro Pump and isn't threatened by Hitmonchan after a Barrier boost either. This allows it to start the Baton Pass chain on the right foot and get the Defense boost its teammates will need to continue the chain.

That said, most players will assume an attempt at a rain sweep as soon as Huntail's presence is known, allowing this set to function more as an offensive pivot and play around your opponent's assumptions. Baton Pass also gives Huntail a bit more momentum than Seadra does, and passing a Substitute to a teammate like Bulk Up Hitmonchan can be game-changing.

While its Attack is actually higher than its Special Attack, it doesn't have any notable moves nor STAB to make use of it apart from Double-Edge and Hidden Power, although it does get Screech to add some oomph to its attacks. Crunch is an alternate coverage option available to Huntail, but is really only useful for Chimecho, and Huntail's STAB attacks do more to Chimecho than Crunch does with rain active. Blizzard is an option over Ice Beam to threaten Bellossom a bit more, but its accuracy sucks. Refresh can protect Huntail from Thunder Wave from the likes of Octillery and Kecleon, as well as other status, but is hard to fit on its sets. Finally, Toxic is an option to whittle down Dewgong and Bellossom if they lack Rest, which may be more helpful in the long run than Huntail's other attacks.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>By avoiding the 3HKO from Hidden Power Grass and being able to heal off any damage done to it, RestTalk Dewgong is about the only true counter to Huntail available in the tier. The next best answer is specially defensive Bellossom, particularly those that carry Sunny Day, but they will still take a number from Ice Beam. Castform gets a special mention here as being a solid offensive check, although it is still 2HKOed by a Mystic Water- and rain-boosted Hydro Pump while only being able to 2HKO back with Thunderbolt (it does get the OHKO with a Modest Thunder, however). RestTalk Wailord with Roar is a great answer to Huntail, as it too can heal off the damage from Hidden Power Grass and use Roar to disrupt Huntail's rain turns. Lickitung, Kecleon, and Wigglytuff are good checks to Huntail if they can nail it with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance, and proceed to stall out its rain turns with Wish and Protect or Rest. Roselia just barely avoids the 2HKO from Ice Beam if it switches into it, and can proceed to use Giga Drain to deal huge damage to Huntail or paralyze it with Stun Spore. Outside of rain, Huntail is rather easy to revenge kill with fast Pokemon that have powerful Electric- or Grass-type attacks like Plusle, Haunter, and Grovyle.</p>\n",

Rock Slide completes almost perfect coverage alongside Earthquake and takes out Flying-types and Haunter. Ice Beam and Blizzard both get STAB, and even without any investment, they get a really good hit on defensive Tangela and the other Grass-types in the tier without having to reach for the recoil-inducing Double-Edge. That said, Double-Edge is super strong and generally hits the Pokemon that resist or are immune to Earthquake for really good damage, making it a good safe move to use when unsure of what the opponent is planning to do next.</p>\n<p>44 Speed EVs let Piloswine outspeed minimum Speed Swalot and Relicanth, with the remaining EVs pumped into HP and Attack for bulk and power. A Naughty nature ensures that Ice Beam and Blizzard aren't reduced in power. More Speed can definitely be run, even up to max Speed if overall bulk isn't needed, which gets Piloswine the jump on other major defensive Pokemon like Dewgong, Chimecho, Flareon, and Pelipper.</p>\n<p>Toxic is an option to cripple the bulky Water-types that are likely to switch into Piloswine, particularly Pelipper. However, with a layer of Spikes on the opposing side of the field, Piloswine cleanly 2HKOes even fully physically defensive Whiscash and isn't OHKOed by Surf in return, assuming the above EV spread. Piloswine tends to draw in Fire-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks, making special walls like Flareon, Kecleon, and Dewgong really important teammates to bring with Piloswine. Venomoth and Flying-types also make good switch-ins to Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle can scare out most Water-types.</p>\n<p>Hitmonchan is very dangerous for this set to deal with, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types important teammates to bring when using Piloswine. Piloswine also makes a really good check to Plusle and Haunter, unlike most of the other Ground- or Rock-types in the tier, due in part to its higher bulk, its immunity to Electric, and the fact that it's not totally destroyed by Grass- or Ice-type attacks. With this fact in mind, Piloswine also makes a good partner to Pokemon especially weak to the aforementioned Pokemon, such as Huntail and Mawile.</p>\n"

While not packing as much power as with a Choice Band, this set aims to take attacks and dish them out, spreading and taking as much damage as possible before going down. This set is very flexible thanks to the ability to switch moves, and Piloswine's longevity is truly surprising with just Leftovers recovery.</p>\n<p>To give an idea of Piloswine's tankishness, with the given EV spread, Piloswine avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Raticate's Return after Protect and easily 2HKOes with Earthquake in return. This set is also less susceptible to special attackers like Plusle and Haunter than most of Piloswine's other sets due to its ability to stall for Leftovers recovery and switch moves to play around those sporting Levitate.</p>\n<p>Ice Beam and Blizzard do a good amount of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, as well as to Tangela. Toxic + Protect allows Piloswine to spread residual damage around the opponent's team and stall for Leftovers recovery. However, either can be replaced with Roar, which is an actually highly sought-after move in the tier and allows Piloswine to phaze dangerous setup sweepers like Bulk Up Vigoroth and rack up potential Spikes damage.</p>\n<p>The Special Attack investment of this set allows Piloswine to OHKO Tangela, offensive Shelgon, and Murkrow with Ice Beam as well as get the 2HKO on Haunter. With the same spread, Blizzard has a chance to OHKO even Pidgeot and ensures the OHKO on Graveler. Brave is the needed nature to make sure Earthquake does enough damage to relevant targets like Swalot, with which Piloswine easily 2HKOes physically defensive variants. All this said, the STAB Ice move and Special Attack investment can be dropped in favor of Rock Slide or Double-Edge with the EVs pumped into Attack instead. However, doing so removes a lot of utility and uniqueness that Piloswine holds by making use of its Ice STAB.</p>\n<p>Piloswine is a little harder to switch into with this set for defensive Pokemon, as many do not like taking a potential Toxic, but Grass- and Water-type switch-ins will still be the most common. RestTalk Dewgong in particular can switch into this set without much fear, so a teammate that can take it out like Hitmonchan is a must. Flareon, Murkrow, and Haunter make good teammates to capitalize on the opponent's Grass-types and appreciate Piloswine's ability to spread damage around the opposing team, making a few KOs for the latter two in particular easier when Toxic and Spikes damage have been spread around a bit. As always, Hitmonchan is super threatening for Piloswine, making Chimecho a brilliant teammate as well as Poison-types such as Golbat and Swalot.</p>\n"

Piloswine also lures in Hitmonchan too, making Reflect a decent alternative to Light Screen, although Piloswine will only be doing 72.3 - 85.5% to 4/0 Hitmonchan with Earthquake and the given EV spread.</p>\n<p>Screen support in general is great in NU. To give an idea of its effectiveness, Modest Huntail can't even OHKO Piloswine with Surf in the rain with Light Screen up, while Piloswine in return can rack up damage with Toxic or Earthquake or safely switch out to a teammate like Plusle to take it head on. The possibilities are truly endless with this set, allowing Piloswine to tank attacks from Pokemon it otherwise fears, such as Flareon, Tangela, and Roselia, and really turn the tables on them, with the only caveat being you must be able to predict and set up the Light Screen on the switch. The combination of a screen and Roar also makes Piloswine arguably the best phazer in the tier, for five turns at a time anyway, and prevents really dangerous threats from being able to use Piloswine as setup bait.</p>\n<p>The EV spread includes Special Attack investment to allow Piloswine to OHKO Shelgon, Tangela, and Murkrow with Ice Beam and OHKO Pidgeot and Graveler with Blizzard. Blizzard also allows Piloswine to 2HKO bulky Sunny Day Bellossom after Spikes while only taking roughly ~60% in return from Solar Beam from behind a Light Screen.</p>\n<p>Plusle absolutely adores this set as a teammate, as Piloswine most commonly lures in Water-types, and from behind a Light Screen Plusle can switch in especially easily and force the foe out or KO it with its STAB Thunderbolt. Pokemon that enjoy Fire- or Grass-types out of the way make the best possible teammates for this set, as they can then capitalize on their absence and hopefully sweep. Good examples of these include Mawile, Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and frail sweepers like Pikachu.</p>\n<p>Pokemon that can make use of the screen support, particularly setup sweepers, make especially good teammates as well. Bulk Up Vigoroth, Swords Dance Tropius, and weather sweepers like Huntail and Bellossom are all exceptionally dangerous when protected by the right screen. As a bonus, the weather sweepers in particular have an easy time switching into the attacks that are normally directed at Piloswine too. Finally, Hitmonchan is as always a threat to this set, and while rare, it could also be carrying Brick Break, making a teammate that can take it out like Chimecho or Pidgeot essential to this set's success.</p>\n"

However, low Speed, a lack of resistances, and a vulnerability to the many Grass-, Fire-, and Water-types in the tier, as well as Hitmonchan, lower Piloswine's general effectiveness.

However, using a screen not only allows Piloswine to do the same but also supports the rest of its team. Still, Piloswine can make 101 HP Substitutes, and Substitute blocks all status, allowing it to really work its magic against a stall-heavy team where a screen would not. As for other sets, the only one not really mentioned is a RestTalk set. However, Piloswine's lack of resistances makes this set undesirable compared to the tank sets provided above.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The best initial switch-ins to Piloswine are bulky Water-types, as they aren't weak to any of the moves that Piloswine carries save for Toxic and can remove Piloswine with a STAB Water move. Dewgong and Pelipper in particular make exceptional switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide, and Wailord, Whiscash, and Huntail all can make quick work of Piloswine with Surf. Grass-types such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Cacturne resist Earthquake and take little from Piloswine's other physical moves, although they all will take a hefty chunk from Blizzard. Fire-types like Flareon and Charmeleon cannot switch into Piloswine very safely, but they can take it out easily with STAB Fire Blast once in.</p>\n<p>Hitmonchan easily takes out Piloswine with Sky Uppercut, but it too has a hard time switching directly into Earthquake and dislikes Toxic. Physically defensive Lickitung with Heal Bell is probably the safest switch-in to Piloswine in the tier, although it's massive setup bait for much of the tier and needs to be careful of the screen lure set. In the same vein, Heal Bell Chimecho can switch into most Piloswine easily but needs to be careful of Choice Band-boosted attacks like Double-Edge. Finally, Bulk Up Vigoroth can usually use non-Choice Band Piloswine as setup fodder, but it needs to be careful of Toxic and can get phazed if it doesn't have Encore.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>A Choice Band set is probably the best way to make the best use of Crawdaunt's massive base 120 Attack stat, despite the lack of physical STAB moves. Double-Edge is Crawdaunt's strongest physical move and will hit like a truck, being only marginally weaker than Choice Band Raticate's own STAB-boosted Double-Edge. Return is a viable alternative if the recoil is unappealing and will still be Crawdaunt's strongest available physical move on the set. Hidden Power Ghost is used to annihilate Haunter and is Crawdaunt's best weapon against Chimecho, which Crawdaunt can generally switch into without much fear if it lacks Hidden Power Electric. Brick Break takes out Mawile, Lickitung, and Kecleon and will generally be used as a safety move. The last slot is saved for a special move to allow Crawdaunt to eliminate those targets that either resist its physical moves or just have substantially more Defense than Special Defense. Surf is boosted by STAB and is Crawdaunt's best weapon for Piloswine, physically defensive Sableye, Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Lairon, and Mawile, 2HKOing it after a layer of Spikes. Ice Beam can be used instead to take out Tangela, and it still hits some Rock-types harder than Crawdaunt's other moves, particularly Graveler. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is an option over Hidden Power Ghost to completely devastate Relicanth and Whiscash more than Crawdaunt's other options.</p>\n<p>The EV spread maxes out Attack to give Crawdaunt's physical moves as much damage output as possible, and enough Speed is run to outspeed minimum Speed base 70s like Dewgong. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to beef up the power of Crawdaunt's special move of choice.</p>\n<p>Crawdaunt's movepool is actually pretty extensive, and there are a few viable alternatives that can be run in the last slot. Going fully physical is definitely an option, with the Special Attack EVs then moved into Speed, which then ensures Crawdaunt can get the jump on maximum Speed Modest Bellossom and Huntail before they set up weather. If going fully physical, Sludge Bomb is probably the best option for the last slot, as it completely destroys Bellossom and even OHKOes uninvested Tangela. Hidden Power Rock is another great choice, as it has neutral coverage and is a good safety move to have, but nearly every target that it's super effective against takes about the same damage from Double-Edge anyway. Other special moves that can be run in the last slot include Crunch and Crabhammer, but they're generally less effective than the other options. Choice Band can be dropped in favor of Leftovers, which allows Crawdaunt the ability to switch moves and pummel the opposition with the correct move, but a lot of power is lost on its physical attacks if taking this route.</p>\n<p>Crawdaunt's role on a team with this set is to open holes in the opposition for another physical sweeper to come in later in the match and clean up the remains. Good options to do so are those that enjoy having Rock-types weakened or out of the way like Pidgeot and Murkrow, as well as generally good physical sweepers like Raticate, Vigoroth, and Hitmonchan. There's little that can actually switch into Crawdaunt completely safely, though Relicanth stands out as the most prominent if Hidden Power Grass isn't run, so having a switch-in to it such as Hitmonchan or a Grass-type like Tangela is desirable. Sableye also doesn't fear much from this set, being immune to Double-Edge and Brick Break and taking little from Hidden Power Ghost or the special move. Bringing a strong special attacker like Bellossom or Flareon to smash it to pieces would be a good idea when using Crawdaunt. Torkoal also switches into this set quite easily, even if Crawdaunt has Surf, making a Rock-type of your own like Magcargo or Sudowoodo a good teammate to have.</p>\n<p>Plusle and Grass-types cannot switch directly into Crawdaunt, but they do easily OHKO it once they get in, so having a teammate to tank their attacks and allow Crawdaunt to switch out is a good idea. Whiscash, Kecleon, and Swalot can all do this pretty well and mesh with Crawdaunt's typing pretty well too. Finally, Hitmonchan itself is pretty threatening for Crawdaunt, so having a teammate like Chimecho or Sableye is a good idea too.</p>\n"

Ice Beam pairs very nicely with Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and shreds Tangela apart while dealing a nice chunk of damage to Bellossom and Roselia. The last slot can go to Hidden Power Electric to get a super effective hit on Water-types like Pelipper and Huntail. However, Substitute can be used instead to protect Crawdaunt from revenge killers and status, and it allows Crawdaunt to more easily select the correct move for the situation. Another viable option for the last slot is Taunt, which is Crawdaunt's only real hope of being able to break past Sableye effectively and can trip up other defensive switch-ins like Dewgong, Swalot, and Wailord pretty nicely.</p>\n<p>There isn't much point to running any HP investment, considering Crawdaunt's terrible overall bulk, so maximum Speed is run to give Crawdaunt the edge against Modest Bellossom and Huntail. A Timid nature is an option as well, but making full use of Crawdaunt's good Special Attack is recommended, despite Timid coming with the advantage of outspeeding Timid Bellossom and Huntail. Going mixed is not recommended either, as then you are playing with a slightly worse version of the Choice Band set, and the only physical move of note that's really missed with this set is Brick Break.</p>\n<p>Toxic is a good move to run in the last slot as well, as it is Crawdaunt's best general weapon against special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which Crawdaunt has no real hope of breaking past otherwise. Hitmonchan makes a good partner to smash these as well as other special walls like Lickitung, and together Hitmonchan and Crawdaunt make a pretty fearsome offensive core, as Hitmonchan loves Crawdaunt's ability to remove Chimecho from the picture. Plusle and Grass-types have a really hard time switching into this set, but once in, they can obliterate Crawdaunt with their STAB move of choice.

Still, if it's an unpredictable wallbreaker you're looking for, Crawdaunt is a fine candidate for offensive teams.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>The only major moves not mentioned above that are done well by Crawdaunt are Endeavor and Counter. Counter is extremely hard to use due to Crawdaunt's frailty, but from behind a teammate's Reflect it can be used effectively. Endeavor could see use on a Salac Berry set, but it is also pretty hard to use. As for other move choices, Icy Wind is an interesting move to cripple a potential revenge killer and give Crawdaunt the opportunity to threaten a KO with an appropriate move. Knock Off is a great move in general to remove the longevity of certain walls likely to switch into Crawdaunt, like Sableye and Wailord.</p>\n<p>Most other sets available to Crawdaunt are done better by Kingler, which sports slightly higher Attack, significantly higher Speed, a lack of a Fighting-type weakness, and better physical bulk. This includes, in particular, any Swords Dance or Salac Berry sets as well as any combination of the two.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Probably the best overall switch-in to Crawdaunt is Sableye, which really only fears Surf from the special attacking set or the rare Toxic or Taunt. Otherwise, it easily switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set and can outstall Crawdaunt with Toxic and Recover or use it as setup fodder for Calm Mind. Relicanth also switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set without fear, save for the uncommon Hidden Power Grass, and it can retaliate with its Rock-type STAB moves. However, Relicanth must be careful around the special attacking set. Tangela only fears Ice Beam and Sludge Bomb from the Choice Band set, but it cannot switch into anything very safely from the special attacking set. Rock-types and Mawile can easily tank Double-Edge or Return from the Choice Band set, but most of the other moves will leave a hefty dent or KO them if the opponent predicts wrong. In general, bulky Water-types like physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can switch into most attacks from the Choice Band set, save for Double-Edge, and they fear little from the special attacking set.</p>\n<p>Hitmonchan, Plusle, Haunter, and most strong special attackers with a super effective move can revenge kill Crawdaunt without much issue, but they really cannot switch into anything safely. Finally, most strong physical attackers like Choice Band Piloswine can tank a physical attack and OHKO in return.</p>\n",

It's rather risky, though, and needs to be executed flawlessly\nor it won't work. Thunder Wave can catch Metagross and Tyranitar on the\nswitch and is a nice alternative. Safeguard + Recover enables Alakazam\nto always beat Blissey one-on-one, and Taunt works against Blissey as\nwell as Celebi. With Knock Off, Alakazam can really hurt the tanking\npotential of Blissey and Snorlax, and if used on the switch-in, it gives\naway whether or not your opponent is using Choice Band Tyranitar. Toxic\nworks on just about anything, especially Claydol and Tyranitar.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Blissey, the best special wall in the game, is a good initial switch-in\nto also scout Alakazam's moveset, as she beats most Calm Mind\nvariants--namely, those without Recover. However, watch out for\nunorthodox moves such as Focus Punch, Trick, and Knock Off, as these\nwill be very annoying. Snorlax takes more damage from Psychic, and\nunlike Blissey cannot recover health with Soft-Boiled, but he doesn't\nmind being Tricked a Choice Band as much, and he can usually OHKO or\n2HKO Alakazam. If Alakazam carries Recover, Blissey's only way to beat\nit is with damaging status moves. Thunder Wave will prevent Alakazam\nfrom sweeping, but Blissey still won't be able to beat Alakazam\none-on-one unless she gets lucky with full paralysis. A badly poisoned\nAlakazam, however, will eventually faint, and one can always try for the\nfreeze with Ice Beam. The problem with Ice Beam is that Alakazam carries\nLum Berry more often than not, which means one will have to freeze it\ntwice. On average, Ice Beam freezes once in 10 turns, and as Ice Beam\nhas a maximum of 16 PP, Blissey will usually lose this matchup unless\nshe has Serene Grace. Note that thanks to Synchronize, if Blissey\nparalyzes or poisons Alakazam, she will suffer from the same status\ncondition until you switch her out or use Aromatherapy.</p>\n<p>Houndoom is immune to Psychic, and--depending on his ability--resists or\nis immune to Fire Punch. Additionally, he has both Crunch and Pursuit to\nOHKO Alakazam whether it stays in or switches out. However, if Alakazam\nhas Hidden Power Water or Thunder Punch, Houndoom will be 2HKOed, or\neven OHKOed if Alakazam has a Calm Mind boost. Tyranitar can use Pursuit\nas well, and is generally a safer bet as he isn't OHKOed by anything\nAlakazam can throw at him, doesn't terribly mind being Tricked a Choice\nBand, and can Rock Slide Alakazam for the OHKO.</p>\n<p>Metagross 4x resists Psychic moves and can OHKO with any of Meteor Mash,\nShadow Ball, and sometimes even Earthquake. However, he is weak to Fire\nPunch, making him a shaky counter. While he can survive a Calm\nMind-boosted Fire Punch in a pinch, beware of being worn down, burned,\nor damaged by a critical hit. Jirachi boasts the same typing as\nMetagross does, and is more durable on the special side. He won't be\nable to OHKO Alakazam without a novelty move, though, such as Choice\nBand Shadow Ball or Doom Desire. Celebi resists Psychic, can Recover all\nday long, and annoy Alakazam with Leech Seed, but it will usually fall\nto Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Trick, Substitute, or Encore. Claydol makes a\ngood check as long as he avoids a super effective Hidden Power or Ice\nPunch, as his Psychic resistance, nice Special Defense, and capability\nto 2HKO with Earthquake or Shadow Ball make him quite a reliable\ncounter.</p>\n<p>Dusclops doesn't boast good resistances, but isn't OHKOed by any of\nAlakazam's moves either, and needs only about 36 Attack EVs to KO\nAlakazam with Shadow Ball. Sableye is immune to Psychic, can Recover off\nunboosted hits, and his STAB Shadow Ball KOes Alakazam more often than\nnot. Beware, though, as a Calm Mind-boosted Fire Punch 2HKOes him.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The most important thing to note about this set is that the playstyle and set remain the same whether you choose to go physically or specially defensive; Lickitung just ends up walling different Pokemon depending on whichever you choose. Specially defensive is the most common choice and arguably a better way to use Lickitung due to the fact that it has no special weaknesses, and physical walls are far easier to come by in the tier. With a specially defensive spread, Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon that can avoid a 2HKO from Huntail's Surf in the rain, allowing it to stall out rain turns and paralyze or poison Huntail in return. Wish and Protect provide Lickitung with reliable recovery, and it is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Wish, giving it a major leg-up on its main competition in Kecleon.</p>\n<p>Lickitung's main niche in the tier is that it is able to run both Wish and Heal Bell on one set, allowing it to function as a kind of one-stop-shop for stall teams looking to compress roles in one team slot. Heal Bell is pretty invaluable for stall teams in NU, as a lot of stallbreakers rely on Toxic to break through some of the main defensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Sableye and Flareon, but also other defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Tropius. Alternatively, and also somewhat ironically, Toxic is probably the best way Lickitung is going to spread damage on the opponent's team and allows it to outstall Pokemon like Flareon with the combination of Wish and Protect. So, if you have Heal Bell covered elsewhere on your team, likely by Chimecho, Toxic is typically going to be the best choice for the third slot. Seismic Toss is the main option in the last slot to spread consistent damage on the opponent's team due to Lickitung's abysmal attacking stats and allow it to prevent Pokemon from using it as complete setup bait, particularly Substitute users. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used, since it still does a decent amount of damage to frailer special attackers like Plusle and can paralyze foes if that's desired for your team.</p>\n<p>If you already have a special wall on your team, Lickitung can play around with its defensive EVs to better suit your team's needs. A fully physically defensive spread can be used by moving the Special Defense EVs to Defense and changing the nature to Impish. With a physically defensive spread, Lickitung can actually outstall a lot of the physical attackers in the tier not named Hitmonchan, notably Choice Band Sudowoodo (avoiding Focus Punch and Explosion), Kingler, Flareon, and Murkrow. Lickitung can also run a more balanced EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with a Careful nature, which can allow it to take on a broad range of unboosted threats in the tier. With that spread, Lickitung has just enough physical bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and enough Special Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Bellossom's Solar Beam.</p>\n<p>Lickitung's movepool is absolutely gigantic, so there's lots of room to play around with its last two slots; feel free to fill them in with whatever best suits your team. One thing to note is that Lickitung's Special Attack is actually higher than its Attack, so its special movepool options aren't out of the question. The most prominent alternative is Shadow Ball, which allows Lickitung to actually touch Haunter, something it can't do with the given set. Knock Off can be used somewhere on the set to help its team win stall wars, as Pokemon like Sableye become significantly easier to 2HKO without their Leftovers recovery, and Choice Band threats like Hitmonchan are significantly easier to wall without their item. As for special attacking options, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Grass all have their uses and allow Lickitung to better combat certain threats like Tangela, Huntail, and Pupitar should your team need it.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the EV spread chosen for this set, Hitmonchan remains a major threat, as it can easily OHKO Lickitung with Sky Uppercut, even if Lickitung is running a fully physically defensive spread. Chimecho, Haunter, Swalot, or Pelipper is a required teammate if using Lickitung to assuage this issue. Physically defensive Pokemon like Pelipper and Relicanth love Lickitung as a teammate, as Lickitung can wall nearly every Electric-, Grass-, and Water-type attacker in the tier effectively, giving them a solid backbone to fall back on and pivot around, and Lickitung can pass them Wishes because they lack solid recovery of their own. Unfortunately for Lickitung, Rain Dance Huntail can 2HKO it with Hydro Pump, even with a fully specially defensive EV spread, but Lickitung can effectively stall it out if it hits Huntail with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance and continues to cycle with Wish and Protect. This should be a last resort strategy for dealing with Huntail when using a stall team, however, so a primary answer is needed, making specially defensive Bellossom a desired teammate.</p>\n<p>If using a physically defensive spread, a specially defensive teammate like Swalot or Whiscash is recommended; Swalot in particular can still wall Hitmonchan effectively if it's running a specially defensive EV spread. Spikes support makes this set much more effective, as Lickitung can force out a lot of Pokemon and, combined with Toxic, really build up passive damage. Roselia is the best in this regard, as it resists Fighting unlike Cacturne and Glalie, and it is the best fit for the kinds of stall teams you would be using Lickitung on.</p>\n"

It can easily utilize both physically and specially defensive sets, depending on your team's needs, although it has a tougher time going mixed, as its bulk is just not quite there to allow for it. Unfortunately for Lickitung, it is yet another defensive Pokemon in NU that's weak to Hitmonchan, decreasing its effectiveness slightly as a physically defensive Pokemon. Despite that, Lickitung is a Pokemon to strongly consider on defensive teams looking for role compression.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Lickitung's movepool is huge; it just lacks the stats to really make use of most moves. Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon with access to Swords Dance in the tier, and it can use its bulk to find the time to gather boosts. Curse just usually proves itself more effective due to Lickitung's already low Speed, and the Defense boosts it gives let Lickitung out-tank much of the tier. However, Curse is illegal with Wish. Belly Drum is another way to take Lickitung on the offensive, and thanks to its good bulk, it has a chance to boost on a weak attacker without the need of setting up a Substitute for protection, but again, its low Speed and lack of priority can make it hard to use effectively. Substitute + Focus Punch can be used as an effective stallbreaker and lure against the Pokemon that will usually switch into Lickitung, such as Mawile.</p>\n<p>Lickitung is probably one of the best users of Counter in the tier, as it isn't OHKOed by almost anything in the tier, letting it take out select threats for your team in a similar way to Explosion lures like Sudowoodo. Psych Up is an option to copy the boosts of dangerous setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sableye and outstall them. A specially offensive set can be super tricky for your opponent to play around, as Lickitung's special movepool features very dangerous options across the board, including Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, and Surf. The only major thing holding this kind of set back is Lickitung's pitifully low Special Attack.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Hitmonchan is the best all-around answer to Lickitung, as it can OHKO even fully physically defensive sets with its Choice Band-boosted Sky Uppercut. Haunter is typically immune to everything that Lickitung can throw at it and will eventually run Lickitung out of Wish PP. Steel-types, such as Mawile, Lairon, and Metang, are the next most reliable answers to Lickitung, as they are immune to Toxic and take little damage from Lickitung's STAB attacks and typical coverage options. However, most are not strong enough to threaten Lickitung with a 2HKO, allowing it to heal up with Wish and safely switch to a teammate. Strong Choice Band users like Piloswine and Pidgeot will be able to 2HKO even fully physically defensive Lickitung, although Lickitung has a chance to Wish stall Pidgeot out of health if it uses Double-Edge. Finally, RestTalk users with Toxic like Relicanth can outstall Lickitung in the long run if played right.</p>\n",

Hidden Power Flying provides STAB and synergizes well with Reversal, hitting Bug- and Poison-types such as opposing Yanma, Venomoth, and Roselia super effectively.

Toxic is great for nailing switch-ins as they come in, such as physically defensive Relicanth. However, Yanma should be played in a late-game role, not a mid-game role. Hypnosis can be used in conjunction with Yanma's other ability Compound Eyes on a specially offensive set utilizing Substitute and two of either Psychic, Giga Drain, and a special Hidden Power, most likely Hidden Power Fire. This set can be used early- to mid-game instead of late-game, since it doesn't revolve around sweeping but rather around incapacitating foes and firing off attacks. Hidden Power Bug is Yanma's strongest Bug-type STAB attack, but it prevents Yanma from using Hidden Power Flying, which undoubtedly is a stronger coverage move to utilize with Reversal.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Priority such as Mach Punch from Hitmonchan and Quick Attack from Flareon is the ultimate stop for snowballing Endure / Substitute + Reversal Pokemon such as Yanma once they bring themselves down to 1 HP. There are also certain physically defensive walls that Yanma cannot break even at +1, such as Relicanth, Torkoal, and Sableye. Lastly, although they are few and far between, Pokemon such as Golbat and Wailord can phaze Yanma with Whirlwind.</p>\n",

Hidden Power Ground hits Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Magcargo, Arbok, Mawile, and Metang. Solar Beam helps Weepinbell break through Water-types and is the best attacking option against physically defensive Pokemon such as Lairon and Graveler. Alternatively, Swords Dance boosts Weepinbell's Attack stat to absurd levels, allowing it to OHKO a significant portion of the metagame if successfully used, while Sleep Powder generates free turns for Weepinbell to set up sun once more or fire off extra hits.</p>\n<p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Weepinbell to fire strong attacks and outspeed the entirety of the metagame under the sun. An alternate spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used if one opts not to run Solar Beam. Poison Barb boosts Weepinbell's strongest and most spammable attack, Sludge Bomb, to enable important KOs such as a 2HKO on physically defensive Tangela. Suicide leads such as Glalie and Swalot can assist not only Weepinbell but also other members of a sun hyper offense team by setting up Spikes or Sunny Day and then using Explosion to allow the next Pokemon to switch in safely. Bellossom, Tangela, and Flareon make fantastic partners as well, forming a solid offense core that takes advantage of the sun activating Chlorophyll and boosting Fire-type STAB attacks. Pokemon that can beat both Golbat and Pelipper such as Sudowoodo, Pikachu, and Plusle can help Weepinbell sweep. Weepinbell should be brought in late-game, as it lacks the power to immediately break through bulky Pokemon such as Sableye without a Swords Dance boost but excels at cleaning up thanks to its high Speed in the sun and mixed capability, making it rough for offense teams to face.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>With the ability to run a physically based offensive set, Weepinbell differentiates itself from other prominent sun hyper offense Pokemon such as Tangela and Bellossom. While Tropius does compete with Weepinbell as a physical Chlorophyll sweeper, Weepinbell sports not only a higher Attack stat but also higher Base Power on its physical STAB move. However, Weepinbell is exceedingly frail, being 2HKOed even by neutral hits such as Mawile's Hidden Power Steel and Relicanth's Rock Slide. Weepinbell is also not particularly fast outside of sun, making it susceptible to being revenge killed. Weepinbell has an exceedingly difficult time breaking past certain Pokemon like Golbat and Pelipper, as its Poison + Ground coverage only covers so much. Lastly, Weepinbell does not fit on any team archetype outside of sun hyper offense, as it's otherwise outclassed by other Grass- and Poison-types such as Cacturne, Roselia, and Arbok.</p>\n",

However, this comes at the cost of no longer being able to deal with Steel-types such as Mawile and Metang adequately. Hidden Power Fire can be used with a more specially oriented attacking set. However, such a set makes it hard for Weepinbell to distinguish itself from other special Chlorophyll sweepers such as Tangela and Bellossom. Leftovers gives Weepinbell gradual recovery, but Weepinbell is so incredibly frail that what little health it would restore pales in comparison to the extra damage output Poison Barb offers Sludge Bomb.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Golbat is the ultimate check to Weepinbell, as it resists all three of its attacks and KOes back with Aerial Ace. Golbat must be careful of the rare Hidden Power Rock, however. Pelipper is another great check to Weepinbell, as it can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb and fire back with Ice Beam. Tangela can also act as a stop to Weepinbell, as the Sunny Day sweeper set outspeeds Weepinbell and KOes it with Hidden Power, and the physically defensive set can stomach an unboosted Sludge Bomb and retaliate with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Any Pokemon that is faster than Weepinbell outside of sun, including Hitmonchan, Haunter, and Pidgeot, can take advantage of its frailty. If Weepinbell opts not to run Solar Beam and Sleep Clause is in effect, Huntail can tank Sludge Bomb, set up Rain Dance, and countersweep.</p>\n",

This will ensure that the only Pokemon faster than Trapinch after they are paralyzed are Ninjask (who will never ever be paralyzed, anyway, if you are playing a decent player) and Electrode (who will, in the unlikely event that it is paralyzed, almost certainly Explode immediately after you manage to paralyze it), so, for all intents and purposes, Trapinch will be faster than any paralyzed opponent.

The remaining EVs for a Trapinch based around paralysis, therefore, should be something resembling 80 HP, 252 Attack, 176 Speed, Adamant. This is, interestingly enough, the exact point in HP after which Trapinch is best optimized by splitting defenses while pumping HP--at or below 80 HP EVs, you want to only invest in HP to optimize defenses, but after it, you'll want to invest in HP, Defense, and Special Defense.</p>\n<p>172 HP, 40 Defense, and 44 Special Defense EVs will optimize Trapinch's defensive stats with the EVs leftover after maxing Attack.

If you want to make it guaranteed survival from Jirachi and Celebi (assuming they don't invest Special Attack), 152 HP and 104 Special Defense is the spread that guarantees survival and increases physical defensive abilities the most with the 256 EVs remaining after maxing Attack. If you want, you can lower Attack slightly to 232 EVs, and give Trapinch 28 HP and 248 Special Defense EVs, as this will guarantee survival from Modest Magneton Hidden Power Ice (and thus also guarantee survival from Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ice from any Magneton, Raikou, or other non-Zapdos Electric). This will, coincidentally, allow Trapinch to always survive one Modest 252 Special Attack EV Blissey Ice Beam with at least 2 HP remaining.</p>\n<p>Always give Trapinch an Adamant nature, it really needs it to help damage stuff, and it's the only one of Trapinch's stats that really benefits from a 10% increase.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Hit it on the switch.

Come in\nwhen he has some Curses, copy them, and either try to take him out by\nyourself, or Baton Pass to something to handle him and the rest of your\nopponent's team. You may want to watch out for Shadow Balling ones\nthough. Cosmic Power can be Baton Passed as well, but usually begs for\nCritical Hits, which you don't want. Light Screen, like Reflect, helps\nSolrock and the rest of the team to take hits better. Since Solrock\nlures Waters and Grassers, it's not a bad idea at all.</p>\n<p>Body Slam can paralyze opponents sometimes, and Fire move can hurt\nSteels like Skarmory and Forretress in standard. Toxic can help to wear\ndown the Waters that switch in on Solrock all the time, and finally, he\ndoesn't make a bad Rest / Sleep Talk user. It does take away a lot of\nhis offense though.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>For most tankish Solrock, a +Defense nature like Impish is preferred. Max out his HP before working on his defenses, put his Defense somewhere between 260 and 280 to live through most hits decently. Special Defense is welcome to take on Psychics. A few Speed EVs isn't a bad idea either, especially if you're using Shadow Ball. Solrock ties Speed with Claydol, and of course it helps against enemy Solrock too.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>In standard, Metagross awaits him with his resistance to Rock Slide and\nExplosion, and a STABed super effective Meteor Mash for the OHKO.\nEarthquake without a Choice Band will only 3HKO him, so watch out.\nJirachi with Reflect or Wish can be annoying to an extent, but it needs\nThunderbolt and a Calm Mind to really hurt him. Swampert's, Milotic's,\nand Suicune's high durability and STAB Surfs will be a huge problem as\nwell, try to Explode on them and sweep with something else. Check for\nProtect Swampert first though, or do it on the switch. Skarmory and\nForretress take jack from any physical hit you throw at them. Both will\nput up Spikes, and Forretress sometimes uses Hidden Power Bug. Celebi\ncan Recover off all your hits, and may pack a Grass move to really put a\nhurting in you. Dusclops can kill you with Shadow Balls, Will-O-Wisp\nyou, block Explosions and Rest/Pain Split off the damage.</p>\n<p>For UU, generally Waters and Grassers can come in on anything Solrock\ndoes, and use their STAB attacks to put a hurting in you. Most notably\nQuagsire, Whiscash, Blastoise, Poliwrath (usually has no Water moves\nthough), Politoed and Slowking on the Water side, and Meganium,\nVileplume, Bellossom and Tangela on the Grass one. Banette can be a pain\nwith Will-O-Wisp but won't be switching in on Rock Slides or Shadow\nBalls. You must beware of him when you want to Explode though, and the\nsame goes for when your opponent uses Misdreavus.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This is Hitmonchan's flagship set and one of the most dangerous sets in the tier, with devastating power, speed, and coverage immediately upon entering the field. STAB Fighting-type attacks destroy a huge portion of the tier, and Sky Uppercut is a powerful and reliable attack to batter opposing Pokemon with, especially when backed by the power boost of a Choice Band. Brick Break is a bit weaker, but is 100% accurate and comes with the added benefit of breaking Reflect, which is an otherwise reliable way to soften Hitmonchan's blows. Hidden Power Ghost and Earthquake give Hitmonchan almost perfect coverage alongside its Fighting-type STAB move, with the former destroying Haunter and Chimecho, otherwise good switch-ins, and the latter taking out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Hitmonchan's strongest option against Sableye. The last moveslot is up to how you want Hitmonchan to operate on your team. Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a safety net option against dangerous late-game sweepers like SubSalac Flail Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and Choice Band Raticate. Alternatively, Rock Slide completes Hitmonchan's stellar coverage and makes it extremely difficult to switch into safely for defensive teams, eliminating Flying-types like Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius and Bug-types like Venomoth as decent switch-ins.</p>\n<p>A Jolly nature is needed to let Hitmonchan Speed tie with other Hitmonchan and ensure it outspeeds Kingler and maximum Speed base 65s, instead of just tying with them as it would with Adamant. Hidden Power Bug can be used to hit both Chimecho and Tangela in one slot, but Haunter is far more dangerous to teams than Tangela if it gets in for free, making Hidden Power Ghost the overall better option. Focus Punch can be used in the last slot if you think you can predict well; the power of a STAB Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch is almost unreal, blasting through neutral targets like Bellossom and 2HKOing bulky targets that Sky Uppercut only 3HKOes such as Wailord. Focus Punch's power is so great, a super effective Hidden Power Ghost only does about 10% more against targets that resist Focus Punch like Chimecho.</p>\n<p>There are only a few Pokemon that can take on this set without much trouble. Physically defensive Sableye is the most pressing concern for anybody using this set, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can heal off the damage with Recover. Pairing Hitmonchan with a strong special attacker that can blow past Sableye like Seadra or using a teammate that can hit it with Toxic will allow Hitmonchan to eventually break through it. Spikes will also go a long way in allowing Hitmonchan to punch through Sableye and other defensive threats like Swalot, meaning Roselia and Glalie are classic teammates. Any Pokemon that resist Fighting are roadblocks to Choice Band Hitmonchan, as they prevent it from using its powerful STAB moves. Dark-types like Cacturne and special walls like Kecleon can eliminate Fighting-resistant threats like Chimecho and Haunter, and Electric-types like Plusle can remove Pelipper and other Flying-types from the picture. Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow, meaning Mawile is a great teammate; Mawile also comes with the benefit of being able to Baton Pass Substitutes and Swords Dance boosts to Hitmonchan. Keep in mind, though, that the goal is not to necessarily sweep with this Hitmonchan set\u2014it works best as a wallbreaker and safety net. This set should be paired with a dedicated late-game sweeper, such as Dragon Dance Pupitar, SubSalac Flail Vigoroth, or Rain Dance Huntail, to clean up the opponent's team.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Hitmonchan turns into more of a tank, letting it blow through the Pokemon it's meant to take out and keep on chugging. Being able to switch moves is a big selling point in running Bulk Up over Choice Band, as is the added recovery from Leftovers to deal with Spikes and the greater number of hits Hitmonchan is able to take. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan great two-move coverage, hitting everything in the tier for sufficient damage once Hitmonchan has enough boosts under its belt. Earthquake prevents Arbok and Swalot from stopping Hitmonchan's sweep, but Mach Punch can be used to pick off weakened attackers like Raticate, Glalie, and Murkrow. The choice comes down to your team. Earthquake makes Hitmonchan more of a wallbreaker and stallbreaker, while Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a better cleaner and safety net.</p>\n<p>A bulkier EV spread like 196 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to make better use of the Defense boosts from Bulk Up, while still outspeeding maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar. This spread features more Attack than the listed spread thanks to the Adamant nature beefing up Mach Punch and effectively making up for the Speed lost. Specially defensive spreads, with varying degrees of defensive investment are also usable, but having immediate Speed and power is what generally makes Hitmonchan so dangerous. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot depending on the needs of your team, in particular giving Hitmonchan super effective coverage on Golbat and Pelipper. Substitute is an option that allows Hitmonchan to better sweep the opponent's team end-game by protecting it from revenge kills from the likes of Flying-types and Chimecho as well as status from Sableye.</p>\n<p>This set fits best on balance teams that need a way to stallbreak, dismantle common defensive cores, and prevent Sableye and Chimecho from being consistent, reliable answers to Hitmonchan. A big perk to using this set over others is that it's harder for physical threats like Pidgeot and Raticate to revenge kill it, although they still pose a threat should Hitmonchan be sufficiently weakened. Haunter in particular is still a major threat to the success of this set, making generally defensive teammates that can keep offensive pressure up ideal to pair with Hitmonchan; options include Kecleon, Relicanth, and Tangela. This set is stopped cold by Swalot if lacking Earthquake or Substitute, making Chimecho a good partner to take it out; Chimecho can also heal status with Heal Bell.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin in the tier, and it's far and away the most usable, meaning it has a major niche apart from being a super strong Fighting-type. Hitmonchan also has a pretty easy time spinning when needed, as Haunter, Sableye, and Shedinja are the tier's only spinblockers, and only Sableye can repeatedly switch into Hitmonchan without much worry. Hitmonchan also destroys two of the major Spikers in the tier in Cacturne and Glalie and deals a good number on the third, Roselia. All of this makes Hitmonchan a staple on defensive teams, allowing common grounded stall Pokemon like Roselia, Sableye, Flareon, and Relicanth to thrive.</p>\n<p>A bulky EV spread allows Hitmonchan to more easily come in throughout the game and spin when needed and retains its strength on the battlefield with maximum Attack investment. The moveset is designed to allow Hitmonchan to spin as reliably as possible, with Toxic making an appearance here in the last slot to cripple Sableye and eventually let Hitmonchan win the spin war against it. If you're not concerned by that, Earthquake gives Hitmonchan as much coverage as possible with its other moves, allowing it to get a spin off by forcing switches, if the opponent lacks Sableye that is.</p>\n<p>The EV spread has enough Speed to outrun Jolly Pupitar before a Dragon Dance, with the rest of the EVs invested in Attack and HP. Mach Punch can be used in the last slot to make Hitmonchan more of a safety net for the slower, defensive teams it'll likely be featured on, letting it check faster threats that can give defensive teams some trouble like Vigoroth and Raticate.</p>\n<p>Because this set is slower than other Hitmonchan variants, there are a number of Pokemon that can outspeed it and deal a huge amount of damage. This includes dangerous Choice Band attackers like Flareon and Kingler, which can blow right through Hitmonchan's increased bulk with Double-Edge for a near OHKO. With this in mind, this set requires a sturdy backbone to allow it to switch in and out; thankfully, this set fits best on teams that feature such backbones. Relicanth, Mawile, Metang, and Sudowoodo make great physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Hitmonchan. This set has a tougher time with Chimecho than most of its other sets, even with Hidden Power Ghost to beat it back, making a specially defensive teammate to take it down, like Kecleon, a good partner.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Hitmonchan's Focus Punch is one of the strongest unboosted attacks in the tier and absolutely devastates even those Pokemon that resist it, exposing even the most physically defensive versions of Chimecho to a 2HKO from Focus Punch followed by Hidden Power Ghost. Substitute pairs perfectly with Focus Punch, as it protects Hitmonchan from status and revenge kills and allows Hitmonchan to fire off a Focus Punch guaranteed. The last slot is flexible, with Mach Punch picking off most Pokemon that can break Hitmonchan's Substitute and survive a Focus Punch such as Pidgeot. Earthquake is also usable to muscle through the Poison-types that can comfortably tank Focus Punch and Hidden Power Ghost like Swalot and Arbok and is Hitmonchan's best weapon against Sableye apart from Toxic.</p>\n<p>The EV spread given makes Hitmonchan as specially bulky as possible while keeping a decent amount of power behind its attacks, in particular allowing its Substitute to survive Giga Drain from 0 SpA Roselia and Surf from 0 SpA Dewgong. If you feel you don't need these benchmarks and want Hitmonchan to hit as hard as possible, a simple 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread is perfectly doable and lets Hitmonchan gain a guaranteed OHKO on 0 HP Pidgeot. This set can be combined with a Liechi or Salac Berry over Leftovers to allow Hitmonchan to sweep in the late-game. If you go this route, it's recommended to place Sky Uppercut in the last slot to give Hitmonchan a STAB move should it be unable to keep its Substitute up. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot, as Hitmonchan tends to lure in Golbat and this set is apt at taking it out along with Pelipper and Venomoth. Finally, Toxic is another option for the last slot as Hitmonchan's best move for Sableye and can allow Hitmonchan to stall for extra chip damage on foes should the need arise.</p>\n<p>Sableye and physically defensive Chimecho pose a huge barrier to the success of this set, making a very strong special attacker to break through these threats a good teammate. Cacturne in particular can set up Spikes against Sableye to weaken Hitmonchan's other checks and threatens Chimecho out with a STAB Hidden Power Dark. Wish Flareon makes a great partner to this set as well to help recover off the damage Hitmonchan will take from setting up Substitute and to obliterate Sableye with STAB Fire Blast. This set works well as a lure to weaken the opponent's physically defensive Pokemon, opening the door for a late-game sweeper like Kingler or Pupitar to clean up after Hitmonchan throws around a few Focus Punches.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set is pretty unorthodox but can work wonders against frailer, offensive teams should Hitmonchan get a turn to set up. The goal with this set is to set up Agility late-game on a Pokemon Hitmonchan forces out, like Flareon or Kecleon, and proceed to sweep the opponent's team because nothing is able to outspeed it. This set completely turns the tide against otherwise safe checks and revenge killers like Raticate and Haunter, as they are outsped and OHKOed by a boosted Hitmonchan. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan the coverage it needs to successfully sweep, with the last slot taking out key threats to the success of this set. Rock Slide is recommended here to get as strong a hit on targets like Pidgeot, Golbat, and Venomoth as possible and make use of the possible flinch chance should it come down to it. Earthquake is a strong option as well to make sure Arbok and Swalot cannot stop Hitmonchan's sweep, and it is Hitmonchan's best way to break through Sableye.</p>\n<p>With the given spread, Hitmonchan is as strong as possible while outspeeding literally everything else in the tier after Agility, even vastly outpacing maximum Speed Tangela in the sun. Due to this, you can drop Hitmonchan's Speed investment down a bit and pump some of those EVs into HP to protect Hitmonchan a bit from foes' priority moves, but outspeeding as much as possible before a boost may be more beneficial to the success of this set.</p>\n<p>This set should function almost solely as a sweeper, meaning it's going to need teammates to break walls and generally weaken the opponent's team enough to allow it to sweep. In particular, Sableye needs to be removed or weakened sufficiently before Hitmonchan sets up, as it'll otherwise wall Hitmonchan to oblivion. Spikes is the best way to whittle down Sableye down, along with a few of Hitmonchan's other checks, making Glalie and Roselia ideal teammates. Strong special wallbreakers should be next on the list of Hitmonchan's teammates to force the opponent's hand and hopefully get them to sacrifice Sableye or other physically defensive Pokemon. Seadra, Flareon, and Huntail are particularly adept at eliminating Sableye and other Hitmonchan checks from the picture. Alternatively, pairing Hitmonchan with a physically attacking lure to take out Sableye is also doable. Machoke can lure Sableye in and nail it with Toxic, effectively removing its long-term capability to wall both Machoke and Hitmonchan. Other physical attackers like Raticate can punch a hole deep enough into Sableye and Chimecho to allow Hitmonchan to clean up later with Earthquake and Hidden Power Ghost.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Say hello to what is possibly the most dangerous Pokemon in NU. This dominance is thanks to a lot of factors: a fantastic offensive and defensive typing, great stats, an almost perfect movepool that includes Mach Punch, which is probably the best priority move in a metagame sorely lacking in them, and a huge amount of viable sets, making Hitmonchan pretty unpredictable. Along with all of its amazing qualities, Hitmonchan is also about the only viable Fighting-type available in NU apart from Machoke, giving it a place on every offensive team to crush the common Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types of the tier. With practically unique access to Rapid Spin, Hitmonchan is a staple on stall and defensive teams as well. Hitmonchan is the reason Sableye and Chimecho are as important and good as they are in the tier, despite Hitmonchan having ways to bypass them and every other counter to it. Prepare well for Hitmonchan, and consider it on every team you make; your teams will likely be made better with its addition.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>While there aren't a lot of other sets that Hitmonchan can viably run outside of the ones listed above, it does have a lot of alternate move options that haven't been mentioned in much detail. In particular, Focus Punch can be run on any of the sets mentioned above in place of Hitmonchan's STAB attacks or other moves. It's just generally not recommended, as Sky Uppercut is sufficiently powerful enough for most sets and Focus Punch requires precision prediction that is tough to accomplish without the help of Substitute. Liechi or Salac Berry can be run on any set mentioned above as well to give Hitmonchan a bit more oomph in the late-game that it otherwise wouldn't have. Counter is an interesting and potentially useful option to run with a bit of defensive investment, as most offensive teams' answer to Hitmonchan is to revenge kill it with something like Pidgeot; with some defensive investment, Hitmonchan can theoretically tank the hit and eliminate Pidgeot from the picture in one move, a feat that it otherwise would not be able to accomplish. Revenge is an alternative STAB option on any set not running maximum Speed, as the doubled power if Hitmonchan moves second can definitely be worth it. Hidden Power Bug is available for Hitmonchan to get a strong hit on Tangela and Chimecho, but its effective coverage ends there. A ChestoRest set is doable, giving Hitmonchan some much-needed longevity on its bulkier sets, but Rest costs a moveslot that Hitmonchan typically needs. Finally, Thief is an option over Toxic wherever it's mentioned above as a way to cripple Sableye and other defensive Pokemon like Wailord.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Thanks to being immune to Hitmonchan's STAB moves and taking neutral damage from the rest of Hitmonchan's coverage options, Sableye is Hitmonchan counter numero uno. With maximum Defense, it avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band-boosted Earthquake and can Recover off any damage Hitmonchan throws at it apart from Toxic. Maximum Defense Chimecho is the next best answer to any Hitmonchan, as it is only just 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Hidden Power Ghost, which is relatively easy to pivot out of should Chimecho take the hit, and can set up Reflect on Hitmonchan to soften its other blows. Haunter needs to avoid Hidden Power Ghost at all costs, but it is typically immune to the other three of four moves most Hitmonchan carry, allowing it to easily pick Hitmonchan off with Psychic. Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius are generally good switch-ins as well, as they only need to fear the uncommon Rock Slide and can eliminate Hitmonchan with Hidden Power Flying. Swalot and Arbok are good initial switch-ins to Hitmonchan but need to be wary of straying into an Earthquake. Venomoth is practically immune to Fighting, only really fears Rock Slide, and can put Hitmonchan to sleep with Sleep Powder. Defensive Tangela takes 40% at most from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut, allowing it to stall Hitmonchan out with Leech Seed and Morning Sun. Finally, Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster physical attackers, particularly Murkrow, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, and Raticate, as long as they avoid Mach Punch.</p>\n",

Sing can catch any Clefable counter with a quick Sleep,\nand can help you set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch can get you a\nSubstitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Soft-Boiled, Aromatherapy or Dragon\nDance, as long as you're good at predicting. It's a novelty move though.\nWish can be considered an option over Soft-Boiled most of the time,\nClefable is an above average Wisher. It might be wise to use Protect\nwith it, which can also check what a Choice Bander is going to do, it\ncan help your Leftovers recovery and it saves you from Explosion.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>Depends completely on the set, and there's still no strict way of doing them. Using the Magic Stat Numbers article gives you an idea what you can use for EVs on Clefable. Stick with what's given on the sets.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Countering Clefable safely is hard; you'll usually have to use a\ncombination of Pokemon. Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic\nstaller. Steel and Poison-types work as well, though Weezing and the\nSteels should beware of Fire moves.</p>\n<p>Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It\noften has to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a counter easily.</p>\n<p>Quagsire does about as well as Swampert and counters it under the same\nconditions. Hypno can Toxic or Thunder Wave Clefable and wall it, though\nChoice Band Clefable or generally Shadow Baller can hurt, and Hypno\ndoesn't enjoy Toxic itself.

Wish can be used over Soft-Boiled most of the time;\nClefable is an above-average Wish user. It might be wise to use Protect\nas well, as it can scout Choice Band users, stall for Leftovers\nrecovery, and protect Clefable from Explosion.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Clefable is difficult to counter due to its versatility and access to\nSing; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokemon to beat it.\nThe good news, though, is that it's relatively uncommon.</p>\n<p>Swampert walls most sets that don't use Hidden Power Grass or Magical\nLeaf. It can hit Clefable hard with Earthquake, but defensive variants\ncan shrug it off with Soft-Boiled. Alternatively, Swampert can try to\nCurse up against it, but watch out for Encore, or worse, Counter.\nMilotic and Suicune can somewhat wall Clefable, but can't pose much of\nan offensive threat. If Clefable has Soft-Boiled, all they can do is\npoison it with Toxic, or in Milotic's case, put it to sleep with\nHypnosis. Mirror Coat might work as well on Thunderbolt Clefable.\nSuicune can set up Calm Mind boosts and Roar Clefable away unless\nClefable is running Encore; the Psych Up set, however, is Suicune's\ngreatest nightmare. If Clefable doesn't have Thunderbolt or doesn't\ncause paralysis on the switch, Taunt Gyarados is a great counter. Zapdos\ncan put a hurting on non-specially defensive Clefable.</p>\n<p>Jirachi can comfortably set up Calm Mind on Clefable while staying\nhealthy with Wish, as it resists most of Clefable's moves, is immune to\nToxic, and can even make 101 HP Substitutes. In fact, it only really\nfears switching into Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Choice Band Focus\nPunch, and Encore messes it up as well. Celebi functions similarly but\nis slightly inferior, as it is weak to Ice Beam and doesn't pack as many\nuseful resistances to Choice Band or Belly Drum Clefable's moves. Leech\nSeed or Calm Mind Psychic takes care of Clefable quite easily, however.\nAdditionally, Celebi can shrug off Thunder Wave and Toxic with Natural\nCure.</p>\n<p>Metagross takes diddly squat from any Clefable lacking Fire Blast or\nFlamethrower, but it doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Thunder Wave or\nBody Slam, and will lose to Counter variants. Tyranitar can eliminate\nClefable with Focus Punch, or boost with Dragon Dance and use Rock\nSlide. However, it is picked off by Brick Break or Focus Punch, hates\nparalysis, is troubled by Counter if Clefable actually lives to use it,\nand disrupted by Charm if it cannot Substitute or Taunt in time.\nHeracross must avoid a Fire attack, but can otherwise easily switch in\non Clefable and OHKO it with Choice Band Brick Break or Focus Punch. It\nabsorbs paralysis nicely, though, and even sleep if it has Sleep Talk.\nJust don't attack Clefable until you know it won't Counter, and avoid\nCharm as well. Machamp is in the same boat, except with Cross Chop.\nMedicham can OHKO Clefable as well, but has more problems dealing with\nparalysis or damaging attacks in general.</p>\n<p>Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic stall set. Steel- and\nPoison-types work as well, though they should beware of Fire moves.\nGenerally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It\nwill often have to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a Pokemon\nsafely.</p>\n",

If Latios does have Safeguard, however, Blissey can set up a\nLight Screen and switch out to something that can now take those hits a\nbit better. Blissey, and, to a lesser extent, Deoxys-D can also beat\nLatios with Psych Up / Calm Mind and Ice Beam, depending on who gets a\nCritical Hit first (but remember, the Ice Beamers also have the 20% /\n10% Freeze chance on their side). Alternately, Blissey with Icy Wind\nwill also beat Safeguard Latios. Lanturn with Toxic beats Thunder / Ice\nBeam Latios, but loses easily to Safeguard / Dragon Claw. Snorlax can\nsomewhat counter it (particularly Choice Band Snorlax), but has\ndifficulties switching into those powerful special attacks, so it works\nmuch better as a Latias counter, and even then, it's not particularly\ngood. Shedinja stops Latios without Hidden Power Fire / Dark, but if\nyour opponent wants an all-out sweeper set, they are much more likely to\nchoose Latios for that, and thus will be more likely to have Hidden\nPower Fire / Hidden Power Dark. The problem with relying on Shedinja is\nthat Spikes also spell an end for the cicada. Metagross can take a few\nDragon Claws and OHKO with Choice Banded Meteor Mash / Shadow Ball, but\nis 2HKOed by Thunder. Tyranitar can stack Special Defense to take a hit\nand set up, provided Latios hasn't gotten in a bunch of Calm Minds. Sand\nStream also hurts Latios, who lacks Leftovers thanks to Soul Dew.\nDeoxys-A can come in on Recover, Calm Mind, or any other non-attacking\nmove but Thunder Wave, and OHKO with Shadow Ball, but it needs a Choice\nBand or Shadow Tag to do it 100% of the time, unless you have a ton of\nDefense EVs.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The idea behind this set is simple--switch in whenever possible and\nremove any Spikes from your side of the field by using Rapid Spin. Rapid\nSpin is listed first on this set as it is the move that differentiates\nClaydol from other Ground-types in OU, and is an excellent supporting\nmove. In drawn-out games, the deciding factor is often who has control\nof the hazards on the field, and Rapid Spin allows you to exert some\ncontrol, and also give teams that rely on hazardstrouble. Earthquake is\na powerful STAB move that can damage Tyranitar decently and force it\nout.</p>\n<p>Psychic is used in the third slot to threaten Gengar and allow Claydol\nto spin with more ease against it, and act as a check to it to a certain\nextent. Ice Beam is slashed first in the fourth moveslot because with it\nClaydol is a good answer to Dragon Dance Salamence and an excellent one\nto Flygon. Hidden Power Fire is a fairly decent option on Claydol over\nIce Beam, as it deals more damage to Skarmory than anything else Claydol\ncan do,and also destroys Forretress, who can otherwise be a major\nannoyance to the ancient doll. Rest can also be used in the fourth slot,\nas it increases Claydol's longevity and removes its vulnerability to\nstatus, although Claydol is usually used on stall teams that carry a\ncleric, and Ice Beam and Hidden Power Fire allow Claydol to cover more\nthreats in the short-term than Rest otherwise would.</p>\n<p>The primary reason to use Claydol over other Ground-types such as\nSwampert and Flygon is its access to Rapid Spin. Claydol is also often\nchosen over Swampert thanks to its ability, Levitate, and over Flygon\nfor its lack of a 4x weakness to Ice. This set aims to make the best\npossible use of Rapid Spin with a defensively based EV spread that aims\nto keep Claydol alive and well so that it can remove Spikes multiple\ntimes. Maximum EV investment in HP allows for decent all-around bulk.\nThe EVs are focused mainly on Defense so that Claydol can take physical\nbarrages optimally, such as Tyrantiar's Rock Slides, but 40 EVs are\ninvested in Special Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Tyranitar's Crunches\nmost of the time; they also help in dealing with Gengar and Jirachi. 96\nEVs can be shifted into Attack to always 2HKO 4 HP Dragon Dance\nTyranitar with Earthquake, or 144 EVs into Special Attack in order to\nOHKO Dragon Dance Salamence with Ice Beam.</p>\n<p>Good teammates for Claydol include Electric-types such as Raikou, in\norder to check the bulky Water-types that Claydol struggles against.\nZapdos works especially well as it can also safely cover Dragon Dance\nGyarados, as well as Swampert with a specially defensive EV spread and\nHidden Power Grass. Claydol helps defend Raikou against the Ground-type\nattacks that it dislikes, such as Earthquakes from Flygon. The ancient\ndoll also defends Zapdos from Rock-type attacks, such as Rock Slide from\nTyranitar. Heracross is also a good partner for Claydol, because\nHeracross covers threats to Claydol, such as CurseLax, Blissey,\nSwampert, and other bulky Water-types, such as Milotic, to an extent. In\nreturn, Claydol stops Heracross from being Spikes fodder for Skarmory\nand checks Salamence.</p>\n<p>Claydol appreciates Wish support due to its lack of reliable\nrecovery--prime candidates for this are Vaporeon and Jirachi. The former\nacts as a backup check to Tyranitar and Salamence (especially if\nTyranitar is a LureTar which Claydol can't deal with), while the latter\nhas decent type synergy with Claydol. It resists the Grass- and Ice-type\nmoves that Claydol dislikes, while Claydol covers Tyranitar, which\nthreatens Jirachi. Jirachi is also able to switch in fairly well on\nbulky Water-types, Shadow Ball Snorlax, Regice, and specially defensive\nZapdos. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Houndoom, are also good\npartners, because despite increasing the team's overall Water weakness,\nthey remove Ghost-types that attempt to block Claydol's attempts at\nspinning. Skarmory deserves a mention, as between the two of them, every\nphysical attacking type is resisted; the two physical types that\nSkarmory is neutral to, Fighting and Rock, are resisted by Claydol.</p>\n"

Does your team need a half-decent check to Dragon Dance\nTyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and the likes of Flygon and Jirachi?\nDoes your team need a resistance to the QuakeSlide combination? If you\nanswered yes to any or all of the above questions then Claydol is an\nideal fit for your team. However, Claydol is not without its issues.\nFirstly, its ability to check threats such as Tyranitar is substantially\nlowered because it may fall to two Crunches from a Boah or Luretar set,\nand if one wishes to conserve Claydol for later purposes, it is\nsometimes necessary to switch in order to scout a moveset, which could\nput you on the back foot very early in the game.</p>\n<p>Claydol also sports six weaknesses, including those to the very common\nattacking types, Water and Ice. These weaknesses don't do the ancient\ndoll any favors. Claydol also has paltry offensive stats and a lack of\nphazing moves, which leaves it as complete setup fodder for the likes of\nCurseLax, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Calm Mind Celebi, and Calm Mind\nSuicune. Although Claydol is very durable and lasts a long time in most\nstall-oriented matches--Claydol is much more suited to being featured on\nand against stall teams--one must remember that Claydol cannot deal any\nreal damage to most standard teams if your opponent makes the\nappropriate switches.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Claydol can make use of either Light Screen or Reflect on one of its\nmoveslots (besides Rapid Spin and Earthquake), or even both on the same\nset. However, in stall-based games (probably the games that are most\nlikely to feature Claydol), screens are poorer options as five turns in\nADV can often consist of only switches, support moves, and resisted\nattacks. Also, because there is a definitive answer to almost every\nsweeper in ADV (aside from the rare Flail or Reversal users), and\nbecause there is no Pokemon that is overpowered enough to muscle through\nits usual checks (when they're healthy) behind screens, using Light\nScreen or Reflect is a comparatively poor option.</p>\n<p>Toxic is a fairly decent option on Claydol to wear down the bulky\nWater-types that tend to switch in on it, and is also notable for\nenabling Claydol to turn the tables on non-Resting Dusclops and\nCloyster, who can keep Spikes up against Claydol otherwise. However,\nToxic lowers Claydol's utility and ability to check certain threats\noverall, due to the fact that using Toxic means removing another key\nmove from the set. Also, the abundance of Rest and/or Heal Bell or\nAromatherapy in ADV lowers Toxic's overall effectiveness. Explosion is\nalso an option to cause some surprise damage and open an opposing team\nup to a threatening sweeper, but it is not really suited to Claydol\nbecause once it is down, opposing Spikes users are free to set up and\nforce multiple switches. Claydol's Explosion is also comparatively weak\nand may not OHKO opponents such as a healthy Suicune, for example.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert, are the bane\nof Claydol's existence, as they are capable of shrugging off Earthquakes\nand can hit back hard with powerful super effective Surfs. Suicune in\nparticular is an excellent Claydol counter, being able to set up on it\nfreely with Calm Mind, and not particularly fearing Toxic thanks to\nRest. Cloyster also gets a mention, because if Cloyster is the source of\nSpikes for a team, then Claydol will have difficulty keeping Spikes off\nthe field. Every time Claydol removes Spikes, Cloyster can switch right\nback into it and set them up again. However, Cloyster must watch out for\nToxic. Hidden Power Bug or Toxic Forretress can beat Claydol one-on-one,\nand thus is able to keep its team's Spikes up against Claydol. However,\nForretress must watch out for Hidden Power Fire before taking Claydol\non.</p>\n<p>Dusclops is a very good Claydol counter, as it can block its attempts to\nRapid Spin with ease. It can also easily take any attack that Claydol\ndishes out and retaliate with Shadow Ball. The bandaged spinblocker also\ndoesn't fear Toxic when carrying Rest. Calm Mind Celebi does not fear\nanything Claydol has to dish out, and can boost multiple times freely on\nit. However, it should be emphasized that Leech Seed Celebi is not a\nClaydol counter as Rapid Spin's gargantuan 64 PP far outlasts Leech\nSeed's meager 16. Dragon Dance Gyarados is immune to Earthquake, takes\nlittle from Ice Beam and, like Celebi, can set up on Claydol freely.\nHowever, it should be noted that Gyarados should Taunt first against\nClaydol to scout for a harmful Toxic. Regice is a very good answer to\nClaydol, having good all-around bulk and a powerful Ice Beam.</p>\n<p>Heracross is also a decent answer to Claydol, resisting Earthquake,\ntaking Ice Beams well with its fairly decent Special Defense stat, and\nhitting back with a vicious STAB super effective Megahorn. However it\nshould be noted that Heracross is unable to switch into Claydol's\nPsychic multiple times, and must predict to get in safely. Curse Snorlax\ntakes little from uninvested Earthquakes and can set up on Claydol,\npotentially readying itself for a sweep. Blissey walls Claydol all day,\nespecially Calm Mind variants who can set up freely on it.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The good thing about Sudowoodo when choosing it as a Choice Band user is that it is quite flexible in what it can do. Rock Slide and Hidden Power Rock are the STAB move options; the choice comes down to whether you want perfect accuracy in Hidden Power Rock or a bit more power in Rock Slide. Earthquake pairs perfectly with its Rock-type STAB move to form near-perfect neutral coverage. Focus Punch can be used in the third slot to annihilate the foe if a switch can be predicted, but it can be kind of hard to use correctly. This makes Brick Break a decent alternative that still hits the defensive Normal-types in the tier harder than Sudowoodo's other moves. The last slot is dedicated to Sudowoodo's Normal move of choice. Explosion can take out nearly any Pokemon in the tier when backed by Choice Band, and in fact it is the strongest unboosted attack in the tier. Alternatively, Double-Edge is a fantastic safety move that can be great for when the opponent has both Pelipper and Hitmonchan waiting in the wings and you're not sure which they'll go to, and it doesn't have any recoil thanks to Rock Head.</p>\n<p>Sudowoodo is very slow, so simply maxing out HP and Attack is generally the best thing to do when using it. Running enough Speed to outpace Kecleon, Lairon, and Graveler is an option, but there's ultimately not much use in doing so, as the former two don't necessarily threaten Sudowoodo and the latter wins regardless. However, a couple EVs can be transferred from HP to Speed to make sure Sudowoodo can outpace Magcargo and Lickitung.</p>\n<p>There's not a lot of other options that can really find a spot on this set, since Sudowoodo gets such good coverage with the moves provided; however, Hidden Power Ghost can be used for a better hit on Haunter and Chimecho. This set works well as a lead for offensive teams that have a reliable answer to Hitmonchan, as it easily OHKOes common leads like Glalie, Venomoth, Flareon, and Mawile. Because Sudowoodo is so slow, it's easily revenge killed even by most defensive Pokemon running 0 Speed, so it needs some defensive support to work properly. Defensive Grass-types in particular have an easy time with Sudowoodo, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Pidgeot good teammates. Grass-types of your own make good teammates to pair with Sudowoodo, as they can switch into the multitude of Water-types in the tier, and Sudowoodo has an easy time with the aforementioned Flying-types to protect them. Specially defensive Normal-types like Lickitung and Kecleon make for great team choices to form a good defensive core with Sudowoodo. Finally, Chimecho and Haunter are good teammates to check Hitmonchan, as it can otherwise easily switch into Rock Slide and blow Sudowoodo away with its Sky Uppercut.</p>\n"

Focus Punch pairs naturally well with Substitute, providing an extremely strong attack with good coverage when paired alongside Sudowoodo's Rock-type STAB move. The last slot depends on how you want to use Sudowoodo. With Explosion, Sudowoodo becomes a fantastic lure to be able to take out specific Pokemon with a level of certainty from behind a Substitute, particularly the Grass- and Water-types likely to switch into it. However, if you want Sudowoodo to stick around, Earthquake completes Sudowoodo's fantastic coverage and gives it a reliable tool for taking out Steel-types like Mawile.</p>\n<p>Running more Speed on this set has merit, as getting a Substitute up before a defensive Pokemon like Sableye or Kecleon can use Toxic is fantastic.

Examples include special attacking Flareon or Plusle, depending on your target. Sudowoodo still easily counters most Flying- and Normal-types with this set, making it a good defensive teammate for Pokemon like offensive Grass-types and special walls like Kecleon.

An Endure + Salac Berry + Flail set can hit like a truck, but Sudowoodo is excruciatingly slow; although with max Speed EVs, +1, and a Jolly nature it does outspeed max Speed Adamant Hitmonchan. Unfortunately, it loses out to anything faster than Hitmonchan. A more defensive RestTalk set is definitely viable; however, it's largely outclassed by Relicanth, which is more physically bulky and sports a slightly more useful defensive typing.</p>\n<p>As for single move options, Rock Tomb can allow Sudowoodo to get the jump on some defensive Pokemon like Kecleon. Block can prevent an Explosion target from escaping if the opponent predicts wrong. Finally, Calm Mind is an interesting option to allow Sudowoodo to tank a super effective Water- or Grass-type attack and blow the target up with Explosion. Please don't try to sweep with Calm Mind, though.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The best initial switch-ins to Sudowoodo are defensive Grass-types, particularly Tangela, as they take little damage from Rock Slide, resist Earthquake, and can outspeed and threaten it with their STAB moves. Defensive Water-types, particularly Whiscash because it resists Rock Slide, are other good initial switch-ins. Both types really need to be wary of Explosion, however. Other Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-types are good switch-ins as well, as the former resist Sudowoodo's STAB moves and the latter two resist Explosion; good examples being Graveler, Relicanth, and Mawile. However, they all need to watch out for Focus Punch and Earthquake. Hitmonchan also resists Rock Slide and can take Sudowoodo out with Sky Uppercut.

          "description": "<p>Starmie functions well as a special sweeper, with its combined blessings of a great offensive movepool and a usable Special Attack stat. Hydro Pump is Starmie's main STAB move, useful for whittling away at Snorlax and Regice while dealing hefty damage to Swampert, Flygon, and Heracross. Hydro Pump's accuracy is a necessary tradeoff, as its power difference compared to Surf is too great against important targets such as Tyranitar, Swampert, and Jirachi. Thunderbolt prevents Starmie from being walled by Pokemon such as Milotic, opposing Starmie, Gyarados, and other common Water-types. Ice Beam is Starmie's best option against Celebi, Salamence, and Zapdos, forming the famous coverage combination of BoltBeam with Thunderbolt. Rapid Spin typically fills the last slot, as Starmie's offensive presence can force many switches on which Starmie can remove Spikes. As Starmie is faster than it, Gengar cannot easily switch in to block Rapid Spin for fear of being 2HKOed, so Starmie's spin is usually guaranteed even without prediction. It may seem strange to run Psychic and forego Rapid Spin, but Psychic rounds out Starmie's coverage, giving it the ability to OHKO Gengar and some Heracross, as well as being a more accurate STAB option when the risk of Hydro Pump missing is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>The given EV spread allows Starmie to outspeed all Gengar, Flygon, Zapdos, and other fast threats in the metagame while Speed tying with maximum-speed Raikou and opposing Starmie. This Starmie set is going to need a good amount of support if it is going to thrive on your team. Dedicated specially defensive walls give this set a lot of trouble. To remedy this problem, combining Spikes and sandstorm damage is a great way to defeat Snorlax and Regice over time. Skarmory is the best physical wall in the tier and has access to Spikes. Forretress can get rid of Spikes to make sure that Starmie can switch in with more ease while it sets up its own Spikes\u2014this also frees up Starmie's fourth moveslot for Psychic, Recover, or another move. Tyranitar, arguably the most dominant Pokemon in OU, can set up on Regice and Snorlax, and its access to Sand Stream negates their Leftovers recovery. Because of Blissey's unparalleled specially defensive prowess, Starmie will appreciate teammates like Explosion Gengar and Regice, which lure in and OHKO Blissey. Additionally, the aforementioned lures are good at defeating Regice and Snorlax.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Starmie can function as a durable Rapid Spin user with the given set. Starmie is the only Rapid Spin user in OU with access to Recover, and it has the potential to beat nearly every Spikes user in the metagame. Rapid Spin is also useful for getting rid of Celebi's Leech Seed, meaning Starmie can stall and annoy Celebi lacking a Grass-type attack. With Recover, Starmie can repeatedly switch into and spin on Metagross, Snorlax, and other prominent physical attackers. Surf is non-negotiable on Starmie, allowing it to defeat Skarmory, non-Hidden Power Bug Forretress, and Cloyster if Starmie lacks Thunderbolt. There's no need to use Hydro Pump because its low PP and mediocre accuracy are not worth the increase in power. The final moveslot comes down to personal preference. Thunderbolt is good against opposing Water-types, while Ice Beam is useful for Dragon-types such as Salamence. Once defensive Starmie's coverage attack is revealed, it can become very easy to switch into and lose a lot of momentum. A Starmie lacking Ice Beam is an entirely free switch-in opportunity for an opposing Celebi or Zapdos. On the other hand, a Starmie lacking Thunderbolt is an easy opportunity for opposing Milotic, Suicune, Gyarados, and even specially defensive Skarmory to steal momentum away from you.</p>\n<p>The given EV spread ensures that Starmie outspeeds everything up to Gengar, which includes Pokemon such as Zapdos and Flygon. Maximum HP is necessary to ensure that Starmie is able to check non-Choice Band Metagross and helps Starmie stay true to its bulky Water-type status. Reducing Starmie's Speed investment to 144 EVs with a Timid nature still allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as Adamant +1 Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs can be dumped into Special Attack to increase Starmie's damage output. Alternatively, maximum Speed investment is useful for outspeeding other Starmie and bulkier Raikou that do not maximize their Speed investment.</p>\n<p>Starmie does have a few other decent options alongside Rapid Spin, Recover, and Surf. Psychic is good for nailing a Gengar that might be expecting a Rapid Spin. It is also a good secondary STAB move that hits Water-types such as Milotic, though less hard than Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling devastating sweepers such as Tyranitar, which Starmie can take a hit from, paralyze, and hit hard with Surf, and Salamence, which doesn't OHKO Starmie with +1 Hidden Power Flying. Reflect is useful not only for supporting your team but also for allowing Starmie to take on Snorlax with greater ease.</p>\n<p>As far as teammates go, Pokemon that can defeat special walls are excellent partners. With a couple layers of Spikes down, Metal Sound Zapdos has no problems beating even Blissey, the premier special wall in ADV. Regice and Gengar with Focus Punch or Explosion are good at luring in specially defensive walls expecting a special attack. Celebi can switch into most special walls, with the exception of Regice, and set up Calm Minds while utilizing Leech Seed to regain lost health. Other good teammates are Pokemon that outright destroy most special walls. Medicham is one of the best wallbreakers in OU and can 2HKO every special wall in the tier. Metagross can switch into Regice, Snorlax, and Blissey with ease and proceed to threaten them with a STAB Meteor Mash. Tyranitar has no problem setting up on Blissey and Regice lacking Thunder Wave and can instantly threaten a sweep. Finally, grounded Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support to consistently check threats are good partners for Starmie. Celebi, Jirachi, Blissey, and Snorlax are good examples.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Starmie is easily the best Rapid Spin user in OU, being able to switch into nearly all Spikes users, threaten them out, and spin away Spikes. It is best used offensively thanks to its high speed and coverage letting it check many top threats like Salamence and Tyranitar, but it can also uniquely run Rapid Spin and Recover together, making it a sturdy supporter of a bulkier team.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Starmie is not without fault. Its Special Attack stat is not high enough to defeat some of the most common walls in ADV, such as Celebi, Zapdos, Blissey, Regice, and Snorlax, and these Pokemon defeat Starmie with ease. Suicune can also set up against Starmie with Calm Mind, even in the face of Thunderbolt. These faults make Starmie an ineffective option against bulkier teams despite its incredible offensive movepool. Although Starmie has a number of important limitations, it'd be foolish not to consider it if your team is in need of Rapid Spin support or a fast, versatile, and sturdy special attacker.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Starmie doesn't have many other things to choose from. Perhaps the best niche option is Hidden Power Grass. Just as it does on many other Pokemon, it lets Starmie conclusively beat Swampert, a common tank. Thunder is a stronger alternative over Thunderbolt, while Blizzard is a stronger alternative to Ice Beam; unfortunately, Blizzard and Thunder's relatively low accuracy diminishes their viability. Light Screen is useful for supporting Starmie's team and giving Starmie a better chance at combating Zapdos.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>If Starmie is not running the offensive set, it's very easy to check. Anything not weak to Water, Ice, or Electric (and even some Pokemon weak to one of those types, assuming they're bulky and have recovery, such as Celebi and Suicune) will check defensive Starmie. Even if running an offensive set, Starmie will still be stopped cold by the trifecta of OU's special walls known as Regice, Snorlax, and Blissey. Regice gets rid of Starmie with Thunderbolt, Blissey can set up Calm Minds and threaten a sweep, and Snorlax can do the same with Curse. More offensive checks to Starmie include Raikou, which can take a Surf and set up Calm Minds; Jolteon, which can take any of Starmie's special attacks with ease and destroy it with Thunderbolt; and Zapdos, which can also OHKO Starmie with Thunderbolt. If you're feeling gutsy, Dugtrio can come in on a weakened Starmie and attempt a KO with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. Suicune takes little from any attack bar Thunderbolt and can set up Calm Mind to lessen Thunderbolt's damage and sweep; additionally, Celebi and Jirachi can set up Calm Minds against Starmie. 252 HP / 252 SpD Forretress can take a few Surfs from the defensive set and defeat Starmie with its STAB Hidden Power Bug. It even has a chance to take two Hydro Pumps from the offensive set. Finally, Vaporeon and Milotic can stall out Starmie with Toxic, their good Special Defense stats, and access to reliable recovery. Starmie's access to Natural Cure means it won't be beaten outright by these two Pokemon, however. All in all, Starmie, while an incredible spinner, isn't something to be too afraid of if you run a sturdy specially defensive wall.</p>\n",

The bulk from the HP investment gives Glalie some survivability against non-super effective STAB moves like Kecleon's Return and opposing Glalie attacks not named Explosion. Taunt prevents other Glalie from setting up Spikes for two turns, assuming your Glalie wins the Speed tie. Alternatively, Sleep Talk can prevent Glalie from being completely crippled by sleep leads, such as Venomoth. Ice Beam destroys Grass- and Ground-types that may be leading for the opponent, though they're rare sights. It also deals a ton of damage to Pokemon looking to absorb Explosion, particularly Haunter and Rock-types like Graveler. Explosion allows Glalie to take out or leave a hole in the opponent's lead and limits the number of Spikes layers their Glalie can set up. Explosion is also Glalie's best tool against a few common switch-ins like Flareon and Hitmonchan, the latter of which will be looking to spin away Glalie's Spikes.</p>\n<p>Naive is the chosen nature to make sure Explosion and Ice Beam are as strong as possible. A Hasty nature is an option as well, and both have the same general level of effectiveness in the long run. Max Speed is needed to Speed tie with other Glalie as well as Charmeleon, an admittedly uncommon anti-lead. Lum Berry is an alternative item choice to Leftovers that can prevent Venomoth from totally crippling Glalie on turn one and guaranteeing Glalie to get at least one layer of Spikes against it. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the second moveslot to eliminate Relicanth and other Rock-types looking to absorb Explosion. In the same vein, Hidden Power Water hits Rock- and Fire-types for a decent amount of damage, both of which are otherwise capable anti-leads to Glalie. Finally, Hidden Power Psychic deals a high amount of damage to Hitmonchan and Haunter, but Ice Beam deals a fair amount already.</p>\n<p>Nearly every team benefits from having a Spiker in some way, and this set is the most reliable way of getting at least one layer up early in the match. Unfortunately, Glalie doesn't really provide any type of synergy and should probably be used in the lead slot only. This set works best on more offensive teams due to the fact that Glalie likely isn't going to last throughout the match and will be KOed in the lead slot, meaning it's not going to be coming in later in the match to set up Spikes again if they get spun away. Teams that have a lot of fast, strong attackers like Murkrow, Raticate, and Plusle will make the best use of having Glalie on their team.</p>\n<p>Explosion is ideally Glalie's mode of leaving the match, and there are a few Pokemon that can tank it pretty well, particularly Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-types like Relicanth, Sableye, and Mawile. However, it will leave a sizable dent in nearly everything that is not a Ghost-type or Lairon, meaning Pokemon that can take advantage of the hole it leaves and force them out are the best teammates. Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, and Arbok are all offensive Pokemon that can sweep with the opponent's physical wall heavily damaged. Finally, if the opponent leads with a Pokemon weak to Ice Beam, they'll likely switch to a Fire- or Water-type to tank the attack. Pokemon that can switch into them to preserve Glalie for later in the match make good teammates as well; Kecleon and Pelipper are good examples that can switch into either one.</p>\n"

Shadow Ball takes out the likes of Haunter, Chimecho, and Shedinja, which otherwise can easily switch in on Earthquake or Explosion. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock makes sure Pidgeot and Murkrow can't switch in easily on Earthquake and takes them out without having to resort to Explosion, and it still does a decent amount to Haunter and takes out Shedinja.

Explosion gives Glalie a ton of offensive presence and is a great tool for granting it momentum by allowing it to choose when to go out after Spikes are set. Unfortunately, Glalie is almost impossible to switch in safely due to its poor defensive typing, and its movepool is pretty shallow, giving it little utility outside of the lead teamslot.</p>\n",

If you want to run such a set, use Spikes, Crunch, Ice Beam, and either Explosion or Hidden Power Water with a Hasty or Timid nature, depending on what you fill the last slot with.</p>\n<p>As for general move alternatives, Blizzard is available for a stronger Ice-type STAB attack, which deals significantly more damage to the targets it's neutral on. Light Screen is available to support the team before going down, but most teams would rather make use of the hole provided by Explosion. Rain Dance is an option that can allow Glalie to set up Spikes and rain, then Explode to give a free switch to a sweeper like Huntail. Finally, Sing is risky but available to cripple the foe.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>As Glalie is typically seen as a lead, the best way to limit its effectiveness is to be as prepared for it in the lead slot as possible. Magby and Ponyta are probably the best anti-leads available in the metagame, as they easily outspeed Glalie and OHKO it with Overheat before it can even move. Charmeleon and Quilava are decent alternatives but can only Speed tie it. Vigoroth and opposing Glalie can prevent Glalie from setting up Spikes with Taunt. Venomoth can easily outspeed Glalie and put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, totally crippling it unless it runs Lum Berry or Sleep Talk. A lead Hitmonchan can threaten an immediate KO with Sky Uppercut and spin away the Spikes Glalie might set up, but it's slower than Glalie and therefore susceptible to Explosion. Other effective anti-leads that can normally limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes includes Torkoal, Flareon, and Rock- and Steel-types.</p>\n<p>Outside of the lead metagame, Mawile is probably the best initial switch-in to Glalie because it has Intimidate to lessen the blow from Earthquake, resists Explosion and Ice Beam, and can eliminate Glalie with Hidden Power Steel or Focus Punch. However, it's slow and will allow Glalie to get at a minimum of two layers of Spikes if it switches in on turn one. Ghost-types like Haunter, Shedinja, and Sableye are completely immune to Explosion, and Shedinja is immune to Ice Beam as well, though KOed by Spikes. Lairon is essentially immune to Explosion and resists Ice Beam, though it's really weak to Earthquake. Other Rock-types, particularly Sudowoodo and Relicanth, can easily KO Glalie with Rock Slide and resist Explosion with the latter also resisting Ice Beam.</p>\n",

Fire\nBlast does more damage on average, though, and its extra power is\nhelpful against Weezing and Celebi. Overheat is both accurate and\npowerful, but if your opponent packs two Pokemon you'll need to use a\nFire move for, you're screwed.</p>\n<p>The other moves Charizard gets are rather novel, and usually too\ncircumstantial to work. Sunny Day not only weakens the Water moves\nCharizard is weak to, but also boosts Charizard's Fire moves, and when\ncombined with Blaze, lets it pack a punch. A Swords Dance-boosted Brick\nBreak can bust up Snorlax, Tyranitar and Blissey, but Belly Drum or even\nFocus Punch are usually better options. Toxic can annoy Swampert,\nTyranitar, Aerodactyl and some others; it isn't a bad option as\nCharizard can lure your opponent's main Water-type and help wear it\ndown.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Suicune, Swampert, Milotic, and Vaporeon will always survive whatever an\nunboosted Charizard throws at them, falling only to a Belly Drum-boosted\nDouble-Edge, or in Swampert's case, Hidden Power Grass. They can then\ncounter with a Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos Speed ties with Charizard,\nswitches in easily on Earthquake, Hidden Power Flying, and even Fire\nmoves to an extent, and will OHKO with Thunderbolt.</p>\n<p>Any user of Rock moves also threatens Charizard: Aerodactyl resists most\nof Charizard's moves, outspeeds it, and OHKOes it with Rock Slide.\nTyranitar can take an unboosted Earthquake and either cripple it with\nThunderbolt or KO it with STAB Rock Slide. Furthermore, Tyranitar's mere\nexistence cripples Belly Drum variants, as sandstorm's residual damage\ngreatly shortens Charizard's lifespan and limits its ability to sweep.</p>\n",

It has the perfect build for one too: high HP\nand Special Defense, fairly nice Attack, low Defense, and dreadful\nSpeed. If Curselax is the last Pokemon on your team, there is a strong\npossibility that you can make a comeback, as Snorlax can boost up and\nbeat down common counters such as Skarmory, which can no longer phaze\nit.</p>\n<p>Curse, Body Slam, and Rest are all obligatory moves, but the attack in\nthe third moveslot depends on your playstyle and team. Earthquake hurts\nTyranitar, Jirachi, and Metagross, but leaves Snorlax powerless against\nGengar. Shadow Ball solves the Gengar problem and hits other uncommon\nGhost-types, such as Dusclops, a lot harder. However, it does only\nslightly more damage to Metagross than Snorlax's STAB moves already do,\nand Snorlax will thus lose in the long run. Shadow Ball also leaves\nSnorlax as setup bait for Tyranitar, which is never a good thing. Fire\nBlast's pros are fairly obvious: it 3HKOes Metagross and can break\nGengar's Substitutes, which prevents it from using Focus Punch. As a\nfurther plus, it is also unaffected by Will-O-Wisp. However, Fire\nBlast's greatest use is to nab the OHKO on Forretress and the 2HKO on\nmost Skarmory, which none of the other moves can. However, it too\nprovides setup opportunities for Tyranitar. Hidden Power Steel also\nbreaks Gengar's Substitutes while hitting Tyranitar super effectively.\nHowever, as with Shadow Ball variants, Hidden Power Steel Snorlax loses\ncoverage on Metagross and Jirachi.</p>\n<p>68 Attack EVs and 132 Defense EVs give Snorlax Attack and Defense stats\nof 300 and 200 respectively. The rest of the EVs are split between HP\nand Special Defense, and an Adamant nature boosts its Attack.</p>\n"

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Double-Edge is an option over Return or Body Slam on any set for its\ngreater power, but it gives Snorlax nasty recoil, which can hurt when\ncoupled with Spikes and sandstorm. Therefore, it is recommended only on\nthe RestTalk set. Similarly, Flamethrower is always an option over Fire\nBlast; as long as Snorlax doesn't use a Special Attack-lowering nature,\nit should 3HKO Skarmory and do enough damage to break Gengar's\nSubstitutes. It also prevents Snorlax from being stalled out of Fire\nBlast PP. Thunderbolt and Thunder are two other decent special attacks\nSnorlax can hold off Skarmory with; Thunder can also paralyze opponents.\nSnorlax won't do much damage to Suicune with either, however.</p>\n<p>Belly Drum can work; if it does, it's extremely dangerous. Yawn, Block,\nCharm, Psych Up, Protect, and Toxic are all novelty moves as Snorlax is\nbetter off just attacking. In general, with Snorlax's versatility, it\ncan mix and match moves and end up with a good set most of the time.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Counters to Snorlax depend entirely on its set. Weezing gets the first\nmention because it's physically bulky enough to take most boosted hits\nand can use Pain Split to feed off of Snorlax's higher HP. Furthermore,\nWeezing has access to moves such as Haze, which will eliminate any\nboosts Snorlax can muster from Curse, as well as Will-O-Wisp, which will\nharshly reduce Snorlax's Attack stat while also negating Leftovers and\ncausing a little extra damage. Weezing can hit relatively hard with\nSludge Bomb, and if required, even turn to Explosion to finish off\nSnorlax.</p>\n<p>Virtually any Snorlax set is walled early-game by Suicune, which can\nRoar away its Curse boosts. However, Suicune gets worn down by boosted\nhits pretty quickly and will be forced to Rest; there's always the\npossibility of Snorlax using Self-Destruct on Suicune as well. If\nSnorlax lacks a Fire- or Electric-type move, Skarmory can come in for\nfree, set up Spikes, and phaze it away for Spikes damage. If Snorlax is\nthe last Pokemon, however, these two counters have a harder time.\nSkarmory will only be able to beat Curse Snorlax if Skarmory carries\nCounter and the latter lacks a Fire- or Electric-type move. Suicune is\nfaster and can set up Calm Mind, though it has little chance of coming\nout on top unless it has gained several boosts before Snorlax switches\nin.</p>\n<p>Another pain for Snorlax is Celebi. Without a boost from Choice Band or\nCurse, Snorlax cannot easily 2HKO Celebi, which means it can stall out\nSnorlax with Leech Seed and Recover; it also shrugs off Body Slam\nparalysis thanks to Natural Cure and Heal Bell. To prevent losing to a\nResting Snorlax, Celebi can set up Calm Mind and take down Snorlax with\nPsychic, as long as it plays it safe with Recover. Again, it needs to be\nwary of Self-Destruct. There's also the Metagross / Tyranitar / Gengar\ntriangle addressed in the first set; if Snorlax doesn't have the right\nmoves for them, they will beat it. However, note that it can stall out\nGengar that lack Focus Punch more often than not, even if it doesn't\nhave anything to hit Gengar with.</p>\n<p>Fighting-types make for more offensive checks or counters to Snorlax.\nNone can repeatedly come in on STAB Return, Body Slam, or Double-Edge\nand live to tell the tale, but they can switch into predicted Rests,\nCurses, and, to an extent, Snorlax's coverage attacks as well, and hit\nit on its relatively poor Defense; Focus Punch will hurt Snorlax even\nafter multiple Curse boosts. Heracross puts a big dent in Snorlax with\nBrick Break or Megahorn, while Medicham can use High Jump Kick, but the\nbest checks are Cross Chop users such as Machamp, Primeape, and\nHariyama, as a critical hit will OHKO Snorlax no matter how many Curse\nboosts it has. Besides all this, Snorlax generally isn't good at taking\nphysical hits from the likes of Aerodactyl and Salamence.</p>\n",

On the Choice Band set, just max out Attack and Speed. On the Reversal set, max out Attack to ensure that Reversal can do a decent amount of damage. Speed will have to be 264 in OU, with an Adamant nature, but in UU, you can use much lower speeds, such as 251 to beat an Electrode without +Speed, or even less, depending on just how much you fear Electrode. The remainder of EVs should go into either Defense. Use no HP EVs so that you end up with 1% after 4 Substitutes, instead of 25% after 3, or Reversal will be much weaker. Of course, the extra EVs elsewhere will do virtually nothing, so you'll most likely just want to max your Speed to keep other Salac Pokemon from outspeeding you.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Often more than one Rock-type is needed to fully stop Kangaskhan.

If Machamp packs Facade, Weezing is dead,\nbut it can otherwise take hits well and Pain Split off damage.

Steel Wing is less\npowerful than Iron Tail, but more accurate.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>Gligar will generally want to use an Adamant nature with max Speed to tie other Gligar, or a Jolly nature and 200 EVs, bringing you to 280 Speed after the Speed IV drop from Hidden Power Flying, making you just faster than Adamant Kangaskhan. You should always max Attack, and put the rest in HP. When holding a Salac Berry, get 254 Speed max (196 EVs), as this beats out an Electrode without a +Speed nature. Alternately, you can run 242 Speed (144 EVs), to beat the unused Persian and Sneasel after your Salac Berry. You could go down to 227 Speed (84 EVs) to be faster than a Timid Electabuzz or Manectric after you activate your Salac Berry. This is the absolute lowest recommended Speed.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Solrock, Lunatone, Quagsire, Blastoise, Slowking, Walrein, Politoed.</p>\n",

Minun also tends to lure in Grass-types like Bellossom and Roselia, and Light Screen allows for an easier switch in for a teammate.

Another move option is Protect, which allows Minun to easily heal from its own Wish and can build up Toxic damage on the foe. Rain Dance is usable as well to allow for a Huntail teammate sweep, and Encore and Baton Pass create a lot of good setup opportunities. Thunder Wave is an option to spread status, and Minun's Speed allows it to cripple a few threatening sweepers that other slow support Pokemon may fail against, such as Vigoroth, Arbok, and Hitmonchan.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Hidden Power Grass can be fit on the set, as Minun tends to lure in Ground-types like Whiscash and Graveler. Agility + Baton Pass is another good strategy to consider with this set; Choice Band Relicanth is an example of a great teammate that becomes significantly more threatening with +2 Speed under its belt, and Relicanth is relatively easy to switch into battle thanks to its high bulk.</p>\n<p>Assuming Minun isn't running Hidden Power Grass, Ground-types fear nothing from this set apart from getting locked into a non-damaging move from Encore. This means a teammate that can tank Earthquake is needed. Chimecho, Flying-types, and Grass-types are all good teammates for this reason, and they all appreciate the Wish support and easier switch in opportunities Minun provides. Lickitung and Kecleon also fear nothing Minun can throw at them apart from the rare Toxic, meaning strong physical sweepers like Hitmonchan and Kingler are needed to break past them.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>There's little reason to use Minun when Plusle and Pikachu are in the tier. Offensively, Minun is outclassed by both; however, in a support role, Minun is usually the better choice. Fortunately for Minun, its support movepool is pretty expansive, and while it's outclassed by Plusle offensively, it's still offensively threatening in its own right. The real question to consider is: why choose Minun over other support Pokemon in the tier, particularly much more defensive options like Kecleon and Swalot? The answer should be its incredible base 95 Speed and the fact it has Electric-type STAB moves to revenge kill the likes of very dangerous Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow. Either that or because it's significantly cuter than the other options.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>The main thing to consider when using Minun is: would Plusle be better here? In nearly every situation, Plusle will be the better choice. However, one thing not mentioned above to consider is using Minun and Plusle on the same team. A one-two punch core of two very fast Electric-types could very easily overwhelm the opponent, who's probably expecting one Electric-type at most. This could cause them to lose their special wall like Kecleon early, opening an opportunity for the second mouse to come in and finish the job.</p>\n<p>There really aren't any other options to consider beyond that for Minun because anything else is done better by Plusle or Pikachu. A Rain Dance + Thunder + Hidden Power Water set is possible, and Minun's higher bulk may allow it to set up Rain Dance where Plusle could not, but that's unlikely and Plusle would just hit harder than Minun. Finally, Endure + Petaya Berry + Baton Pass is another option, but again, because it relies on Endure to work anyway, Plusle would ultimately be a better choice.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Because Minun is primarily a support Pokemon, outright countering it is difficult. However, as an Electric-type, it is still fairly threatening to more offensive teams. Therefore, the best general move when faced with a Minun is to switch in a Ground-type like Graveler. Very rarely Minun will be running Hidden Power Grass, but just play carefully and try to suss out if the opponent might be using Minun as a lure. The next best switch-ins to Minun are Grass-types, which only fear the extremely rare Hidden Power Ice. Roselia in particular is a fantastic switch-in to any Minun. Special walls like Lickitung, Kecleon, and Swalot are also great choices to switch into Minun, but just be wary of getting blocked by Substitute or getting locked into a non-damaging move by Encore. Finally, really anything with Earthquake that can tank a Thunderbolt will ultimately defeat it. The main thing to keep in mind is what Minun is doing for its teammates, which is most likely passing Wishes.</p>\n",

Groudon can use Substitute to block Knock Off and\nToxic, as it cannot be broken by weaker physical attacks or Seismic\nToss. Groudon can use Thunder Wave to paralyze Latias, Latios, and Lugia\nand then kill them with paralysis + flinch by pairing it with Rock\nSlide. Don't use Eruption; it's absolutely horrible.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>For the Substitute versions, you will want 404 HP; it's nice for Blissey and Deoxys-D. Sweeping Groudon can have max Speed for the tie or win against Kyogre, which can help a lot. Another option is little-to-no Speed. Groudon is tied for slowest Uber in the game with Deoxys-D and Kyogre, and most Ubers like to hang out at 307 Speed, 1 above Groudon's maximum. If Groudon won't be beating them, why not just power up its Attack and defenses? You could run a very small amount of Speed to beat other Groudon and Kyogre that also have low Speed. For lead Groudon, you might want to be slower than lead Kyogre, so that your weather overwrites its, possibly even using Brave and lowering Speed IVs to 2 (with Hidden Power Bug) or 3 (With Hidden Power Ghost). Regardless of what you do, you will want a lot of Attack EVs unless you are running a stall set.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Latias and Latios are immune to Earthquake, resist Fire, survive\neverything Groudon can throw at them save Choice Band Hidden Power Bug\nor Ghost, and can OHKO with Ice Beam (but Groudon with Special Defense\nEVs survives and can go for the 2HKO). Flygon works, but is very\nspecific and won't do much to almost anything else, and it still needs\nSolar Beam to do anything to Groudon. Lugia can take hits all day with a\nReflect up and can just Toxic stall Groudon to death, or it can\nalternate between Calm Mind and Recover before killing with Ice Beam.\nExeggutor survives everything but Hidden Power Bug, Fire Blast, and\nOverheat, and OHKOes Groudon with Solar Beam (watch out for a Rayquaza\nswitch-in to defend against this). Kyogre somewhat... you won't want to\nswitch Kyogre into a Groudon Earthquake. If Groudon is faster and has a\nSwords Dance on the switch, Kyogre will get OHKOed, unless Kyogre has\n404 HP (252 EVs) and 276 Defense (240 EVs).</p>\n<h1>Controlling the Weather</h1>\n<p><em>Leads</em></p>\n<p>In a match-up of Kyogre vs. Groudon, if both Pokemon are the first each battler sends out, the slower Pokemon will always control the weather. This is because the faster Pokemon's weather activates first, but is promptly overwritten by the slower Pokemon's.</p>\n<p><em>Switches</em></p>\n<p>If Kyogre switches into Groudon or vice versa, the weather will change.</p>\n<p>If Kyogre and Groudon switch in at the same time, then the person who makes the decision last switches in their Pokemon last, thus dominating the skies. In matches where a person has a limited amount of time to move, this can cause the players to try and play chicken, waiting until the clock is as close to running out as they dare before punching in the move and praying the connection doesn't lag.</p>\n<p><em>Rayquaza / Golduck</em></p>\n<p>If Rayquaza or Cloud Nine Golduck is out, the game will report that the weather is still going strong. However, there will be no effect. Solar Beam takes two turns, Thunder has 70% accuracy, and no moves are boosted or weakened. If Kyogre or Groudon switch into Rayquaza, Air Lock will still be in play. Once Rayquaza leaves the field, the weather returns to normal.</p>\n",

Substitute variants can be\na hindrance, however, as Substitute protects Nidoqueen from Will-O-Wisp,\nand Nidoqueen's Substitutes survive one Sludge Bomb. While Focus Punch\nwill put a dent in it, Skarmory takes most of Nidoqueen's physical\nattacks easily, thanks especially to its immunities to Sludge Bomb and\nEarthquake. As long as Nidoqueen doesn't pack a Fire or an Electric\nmove, Skarmory can easily lay Spikes, phaze Nidoqueen away for some\ntoken damage, or wear it down with Drill Peck.

In return, it can badly damage\nNidoqueen with Earthquake, which OHKOes if Flygon is equipped with a\nChoice Band. However, a fully defensive Nidoqueen can survive non-Choice\nBand Flygon's Earthquake and KO it with Counter.

          "description": "<p>Wigglytuff's horrid defenses, low Speed, and massive HP stat create the perfect conditions for Wigglytuff to eat attacks and make use of Counter. Thanks to that gargantuan HP, nearly every attack Wigglytuff Counters is going to KO the foe right back. Luckily for Wigglytuff, while its horrid defenses mean it's usually 2HKOed by most Choice Band-boosted STAB moves, it usually isn't OHKOed unless it's a Fighting-type move, further increasing the use of Counter considering the large number of non-Fighting-type Choice Band users in the tier, including Graveler, Relicanth, and Pidgeot.</p>\n<p>Wish and Protect allow Wigglytuff to survive throughout the match, support the team, and possibly even use Counter more than once. Protect also allows it to scout the moves of Choice Band attackers and react accordingly. Return is for a reliable STAB attack; however, Toxic can be used, as Wigglytuff is going to be utterly walled by Haunter and Steel-types anyway, and Wigglytuff can provide a defensive role by using Toxic to stall out certain weak attackers like Sableye and defensive Flareon.</p>\n<p>An Impish nature ensures Wigglytuff can survive as many physical moves as possible and be able to hit back with Counter. With max HP investment, Wigglytuff's Counter is going to one-shot pretty much anything that doesn't OHKO it. While typically it would be better to invest in both defenses and leave Wigglytuff's HP alone, which will increase Wigglytuff's overall bulk significantly, investing fully in HP actually increases Wigglytuff's physical bulk significantly enough to allow it to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Sudowoodo's Double-Edge where it wouldn't otherwise.</p>\n<p>If you check Wigglytuff's learnset, you'll notice how you can scroll for quite a while before reaching the bottom. There are a ton of moves that can be used in place of any of Wish, Protect, or the last slot depending on your team and what you want Wigglytuff to accomplish. Some good choices include strong damaging moves like Fire Blast, Blizzard, Focus Punch, Psychic, and Thunder to make use of Wigglytuff's decent attacking stats, a consistent move like Seismic Toss, support options like Safeguard, Reflect, Light Screen, Sunny Day, and Rain Dance, and other niche moves like Perish Song.</p>\n<p>Having a switch-in to Hitmonchan's Fighting-type attacks is needed for this set to be successful, making Swalot and Pelipper good teammates. Really strong special attackers like Rain Dance Huntail just shred right through Wigglytuff, meaning dedicated special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong should be considered, and both appreciate the healing that Wish can provide. Wigglytuff can usually scare off physical attackers with the threat of Counter, making Spikes paired with it extra effective, and Roselia makes a naturally good partner to it. All that said, Wigglytuff actually fits quite well on heavy offense teams as a lure to blow back certain physical attackers, heal a teammate with Wish, and open the opponent's team a bit to aid in a teammate's sweep.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Wigglytuff plays a complete support role for offensive teams with this set, setting up a screen, passing a Wish to a teammate, and eventually allowing itself to be KOed to keep momentum going for its team. Safeguard is a neat alternate option to Wish that's uncommon in NU and ensures that Wigglytuff's teammate can't be stricken with status. Although it's kind of hard to set up both a screen (or both screens if you're crazy) and Safeguard all in one go, it can ensure the perfect setup conditions for a frailer sweeper that doesn't want to worry about status ruining its sweep, such as Swords Dance Kingler or Dragon Dance Pupitar. Thunder Wave and Body Slam are used to spread paralysis on the opponent's team to make sweeping easier for a teammate. While Wigglytuff is slightly outclassed by Metang with this set, as Metang has Explosion to get off the field quickly, Wigglytuff's higher special bulk and access to Wish and paralysis-inducing moves make it a decent alternative.</p>\n<p>The EV spread provided best allows Wigglytuff to set up a screen and use Wish before being KOed. Maximum Speed can be run to allow Wigglytuff to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible to better ensure it can get a screen up before going down. Protect can be used in the last slot with Wish to increase Wigglytuff's longevity and allow it to survive throughout the course of the match, but that creates a situation in which it's totally dead weight outside of providing screen support, which is not at all desirable in most cases.</p>\n<p>As Wigglytuff is in a complete support role with this set, it shouldn't be the focus of a team. It won't do much in the way of filling team weaknesses and at most will only softly check some weaker attackers. Instead, it should be chosen as a way to try to guarantee a sweep with another Pokemon. Setup sweepers are a must to be paired with this set, meaning Swords Dance Mawile, Dragon Dance Pupitar, Rain Dance Huntail, and Sunny Day Bellossom are all ideal teammates. Wigglytuff tends to lure in Hitmonchan, so Pokemon that can take advantage of its Fighting-type moves, such as Venomoth, Haunter, and Chimecho, are also great teammates.</p>\n"

With this set, Wigglytuff acts as a decent wallbreaker, opening the opponent's team up to a special sweeper like Huntail later in the match. Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Fire Blast get incredible coverage in just three slots, hitting every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage at worst. Thanks to this coverage, the last slot is open to a lot of moves, with Wish allowing Wigglytuff to provide team support or help itself, though it's hard to use without Protect. Fake Tears makes Wigglytuff's attacks actually pretty terrifyingly strong, usually forcing the opponent to switch and increasing the damage output to the opponent's team. Finally, Psychic can be used to nail Hitmonchan on the switch, and it is a nice way to more easily take out Swalot and Haunter.</p>\n<p>Wigglytuff needs all the power it can get from a Modest nature, since base 75 Special Attack isn't overly impressive and the goal with this set is to punch holes in the opposing team. Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible, as this set's main merit comes from surprising opponents who would normally be expecting a more defensive set. Blizzard and Thunder can be used for the sheer damage output they provide, but Wigglytuff gets enough mileage out of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt as it is, making the accuracy of the former two undesirable. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more accuracy, but Fire Blast is accurate enough compared to Blizzard and Thunder, and the extra power can come in handy against certain threats like Roselia, as Fire Blast guarantees a 2HKO against it where Flamethrower just misses out.</p>\n<p>As for other move alternatives, a vast array of Hidden Powers can be used in the last slot to complete coverage on certain targets, such as Hidden Power Dark for Chimecho, Hidden Power Water for Fire-types, and Hidden Power Grass for Whiscash. Focus Punch can be used to get a surprise hit on Kecleon and Lickitung looking to switch in and absorb its special hits, further helping a sweeper like Huntail later in the game. If using Focus Punch, be sure to change the nature to Rash. Toxic is also a decent option to cripple special walls with recovery in extended matches.</p>\n<p>Wigglytuff is extremely vulnerable to Hitmonchan if not running Psychic, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Pelipper great teammates to take advantage of the Fighting-type moves it'll be firing off. As Wigglytuff is actually rather frail without any defensive investment, most other faster, strong attackers are threats to this set, making sturdy, defensive Pokemon good teammates in general. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Lickitung can all provide a decent defensive backbone to support Wigglytuff. Pokemon that can make use of the surprise holes that Wigglytuff punches are great teammates as well, particularly special sweepers like Huntail and Calm Mind Sableye.</p>\n"

If you do want to use Wigglytuff, you really have to make sure you make use of that sprawling movepool. This does make it a bit unpredictable, meaning it's possible to bluff certain moves and get your opponent to misplay around it, and its stats are just good enough to mean your opponent can't afford to do that.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>As stated before, Wigglytuff's movepool is pretty extensive, opening up various moveset options not listed above. The sets given above are what Wigglytuff has over its competition, namely Lickitung and Kecleon. That said, Wigglytuff is able to run other sets to success, just be sure they're not done better by said competition. The big draw to Wigglytuff's learnset is its access to a plethora of special moves, but its physical movepool is actually pretty decent as well, and its Attack is only marginally lower than its Special Attack. A Choice Band set with Double-Edge / Brick Break / Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Ground can leave a large dent in the specially defensive Pokemon that are most likely to switch into Wigglytuff, particularly OHKOing Hitmonchan and Flareon and doing upwards of 80% to maximum HP Lickitung with Double-Edge. A SubPunch set is doable, as Wigglytuff's Substitutes are massive, meaning it can really take advantage of defensive Pokemon that rely on Seismic Toss for damage, in particular Sableye and Lickitung.</p>\n<p>Wigglytuff is one of the few Pokemon with access to Perish Song in NU, and it is probably the best user of it after Dewgong, giving it a bit of a niche on teams that need a stallbreaker. Wigglytuff's signature move Sing is somewhat viable, as sleep-inducing moves are pretty uncommon in NU, and can be paired with Nightmare for some shenanigans, but it's pretty unreliable in the long run due to its accuracy. Seismic Toss is perfectly viable on any set for consistent damage; however, it ignores Wigglytuff's usable attacking stats, and if not using them, you're probably better off using Lickitung.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Thanks to Hitmonchan's good special bulk and ability to OHKO even maximum Defense Wigglytuff, it's probably the overall best switch-in to Wigglytuff as long as it avoids Thunder Wave and Body Slam. Apart from that, it's best to avoid aiming physical attacks at Wigglytuff unless you're sure you can OHKO it from whatever health it's at, lest you risk the chance of eating a Counter in return. Strong special attackers like Huntail can cleave right through Wigglytuff's bulk without the risk of Counter, and bulky special attackers like Chimecho can take full advantage of Wigglytuff by using it as setup bait. Apart from that, it's hard to list any true counters to Wigglytuff, as its movepool is pretty dangerous and most of the time Wigglytuff is going to be in a support role. In general, it's best to scout out Wigglytuff's moveset a bit before switching in something too hastily, but Rock- and Steel-types make for decent safe switch-ins, as Wigglytuff will rarely be running anything to hit them for much damage, they resist its STAB attacks, most don't mind being paralyzed, and they have good enough bulk to survive a hit should Wigglytuff be carrying something specifically for them.</p>\n",

Fire Punch is good for Grass- and Steel-types, such as\nCelebi and Metagross, respectively. As with its fellow Psychic-types,\nGardevoir can make use of Hidden Power Grass to hurt Tyranitar and\nClaydol, and of course to OHKO Swampert. Psych Up lets it steal boosts\nfrom the likes of Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, and then proceed to beat\nthem up: Suicune will fall to Thunderbolt, Jirachi to Fire Punch, and\nCelebi to either Fire Punch or Ice Punch. The paralysis provided by\nThunder Wave is always appreciated, as are the defensive boosts from\nLight Screen and Reflect. Gardevoir can also sacrifice itself with\nMemento to set up a sweep for a Belly Drum or Focus Punch user, but\nbeware of Metagross's Clear Body. Snatch is another way of wrecking\nopposing Calm Mind users.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that while Trace is a fun ability and the more useful\none as well, Synchronize can be neat as it lets Gardevoir switch into\nWill-O-Wisp from Dusclops or Weezing and burn them in return. Gardevoir\ndetests being burned, though, so be sure to pack cleric support.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Blissey sponges any special attack, but she cannot beat Gardevoir on her\nown if Gardevoir has Wish or Rest, and Gardevoir might trap her with\nMean Look. Snorlax hates being hit by Will-O-Wisp, but it can Curse up\nand Rest it off if it so desires, and pounds Gardevoir on its low\nDefense. Calm Mind-boosted Psychic will hurt Snorlax though, so be\ncareful. Metagross resists Psychic and Ice Punch and can Meteor Mash\nGardevoir into oblivion; just avoid Will-O-Wisp and Fire Punch.\nTyranitar is immune to Psychic and can dent Gardevoir with STAB Rock\nSlide or Crunch, but again, beware of Will-O-Wisp. Celebi and Jirachi\nboth resist Psychic and can engage Gardevoir in a Psychic war; if\nGardevoir isn't packing Calm Mind, they will likely pose problems.\nClaydol can attack Gardevoir with Earthquake, but if Gardevoir switches\nin, it will Trace Levitate. Psych Up Regice can go toe-to-toe with Calm\nMind variants, but it might need a critical hit or a freeze to emerge\nvictorious. Without Calm Mind, Gardevoir isn't getting past Regice\nanytime soon, though.</p>\n<p>Generally, Gardevoir cannot stand up to strong physical hits. While they\ncannot effectively switch into Gardevoir's powerful special attacks,\nTauros, Aerodactyl, Dodrio, and Salamence are all faster and can put the\nhurt on Gardevoir. Heracross works as well; while it has the advantage\nof being able to absorb Will-O-Wisp, it must be wary of Psychic. Also,\nnote that Timid Gardevoir is faster than Adamant Heracross. Choice Band\nSwellow too will easily OHKO Gardevoir with a Guts-boosted Return,\nDouble-Edge, or Facade.</p>\n",

Because Mawile's Defense is higher than its Special Defense, Fire Punch is the best option for Nosepass to hit Mawile with and 2HKO it. Block prevents non-Steel-type Pokemon from double switching in and out of Taunt. Block can also be Baton Passed by Mawile so that something else becomes trapped. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock is Nosepass's most reliable STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Pidgeot and Murkrow super effectively. Explosion, although powered down by Nosepass's Timid nature, is still strong enough to OHKO Roselia and severely dents Chimecho.</p>\n<p>Magnet Pull is Nosepass's only defining feature, differentiating itself from other Rock-types with its ability to trap opposing Steel-types. Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Nosepass to outspeed uninvested base 60s while also outspeeding most standard 128 Speed Mawile and defensive Pokemon such as Roselia and Chimecho that it can use Explosion on. Maximum Special Attack EVs ensure that Nosepass 2HKOes Mawile with Fire Punch. Leftovers and the remaining 4 Defense EVs allow Nosepass to more adequately take two Hidden Power Steels from Mawile. Poison-types such as Arbok appreciate Mawile being removed, as they can spam STAB Sludge Bomb more freely, making them good teammates for Nosepass. Nosepass and Poison-types share a weakness to Ground, so Pokemon that have the Flying typing such as Pidgeot can provide the necessary Ground-type immunity while also resisting Grass for Nosepass. Chimecho is another great example, utilizing Levitate to provide a switch-in for Ground-types and adding a Psychic-type resistance for Arbok. Be sure to not reveal Nosepass too early; if Nosepass is revealed too early, Mawile will keep double switching out every time it is brought in, and Nosepass will lose all momentum in the process. While its defense stats might suggest otherwise, Nosepass is exceedingly frail and must be played carefully. Mawile can very easily 2HKO Nosepass with two Hidden Power Steels. Once trapped, Nosepass needs to predict correctly whether Mawile is going to attack, Taunt, or Baton Pass. Hopefully, by the time you bring Nosepass into Mawile, you will know what set it is running so that you can more easily predict around it.</p>\n"

Nosepass is able to successfully trap and 2HKO Mawile, however, using a combination of Taunt, Block, and Fire Punch to do so. This doesn't amount to anything, though, as applying offensive pressure on Mawile using Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Flareon or even bringing a defensive Pokemon that resists its attacks such as Wailord or Tangela is a much more reliable strategy. Ultimately, Nosepass is utterly atrocious and should be passed up in favor of a more viable Rock-type or Mawile check.</p>\n",

A set utilizing Rest, Sleep Talk, Earthquake, and Rock Slide may seem alright at first, but again Nosepass is outclassed, this time by Relicanth. While Nosepass isn't a Water-type and doesn't have any 4x weaknesses unlike Relicanth, this isn't enough of a niche to warrant its use, especially considering the steep drop in overall bulk.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Water-types such as Huntail, Dewgong, and Wailord can drown Nosepass out with a STAB Surf. Nosepass is also passive enough for Huntail to reliably set up Rain Dance against and attempt to sweep. Grass-types such as Tangela and Bellossom take Nosepass out with a STAB Solar Beam, although if they set up Sunny Day, they must be wary of a sun-boosted Fire Punch. Hitmonchan can switch into any of Nosepass's attacks bar Explosion and threaten it out with a super effective Sky Uppercut. Pokemon with Rock / Ground typing such as Pupitar and Graveler resist all of Fire Punch, Hidden Power Rock, and Explosion and can demolish Nosepass with Earthquake. Even with Taunt, Pupitar can use Nosepass as setup fodder with Dragon Dance. Even though it's also a Steel-type that Nosepass can trap, Metang possesses overall better bulk than Mawile and also has Meteor Mash, which threatens to OHKO Nosepass after one layer of Spikes.</p>\n",

Double-Edge is an option over Return as it deals extra damage\nin exchange for recoil.

Shadow Ball\nallows Slaking to OHKO Gengar, who is immune to Return, and can\notherwise be problematic; it is also a little stronger against Celebi.\nThe last move is largely filler, and isn't as important as the previous\nthree. Focus Punch is the primary option for its ability to OHKO 252/0\nTyranitar, Snorlax, and opposing Slaking.

Fury Swipes is worth\nconsideration in the last slot to break the Substitutes of and\npotentially KO Pokemon such as Ninjask, Jolteon, and Sceptile. A Choice\nBand is the best--and only--item for Slaking, as it must usually switch\nout after firing off an extremely powerful attack to avoid being setup\nbait or giving the opponent a free attack. Being forced to switch out\nmitigates the locking effect of Choice Band, so Slaking might as well\nmake full use of the Attack boost.</p>\n<p>Skarmory can take any of Slaking's common attacks and set up Spikes,\nwhich severely hinders it.

Skarmory, on the other hand, can\ntake advantage of free turns to set up Spikes. Residual damage from\nSpikes and sandstorm is a big problem for Slaking as, with Spikes on the\nfield and sandstorm in play, Slaking will lose a portion of its health\nevery time it switches in.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Surf and Hydro Pump take down Donphan and Skarmory, and are viable\noptions on the Dragon Dance set. Double-Edge is an alternative to Hidden\nPower Flying as it deals comparable damage to Flygon and Claydol, and\ncan handle Zapdos as well. Paralysis is always a plus, so Thunder Wave\nis cool. Substitute can help Gyarados set up, but Taunt is arguably\nbetter as it prevents phazing as well. Gyarados can use the RestTalk\ncombination to tank or set up Dragon Dance, but will have limited\noffense. Flail can be used alongside Substitute or Endure; if using the\nformer, make sure Gyarados's HP is not divisible by 4. It works nicely\nwith Gyarados's great Attack stat and Dragon Dance, and a +2 Earthquake\ncan KO Metagross. Such a set would have a hard time with Tyranitar,\nthough.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>As previously mentioned, Zapdos is the best counter in the game to\nGyarados. It resists Hidden Power Flying, is immune to Earthquake, and\nOHKOes Gyarados with Thunderbolt. Aerodactyl can do the same with its\nSTAB Rock Slide, but it is weak to Water moves and doesn't have very\ngood defenses. Jolteon is faster than Adamant Gyarados even after a\nDragon Dance boost, and can OHKO it with Thunderbolt. However, it can't\nswitch in easily as Gyarados might predict it and hit it with\nEarthquake.</p>\n<p>Skarmory doesn't commonly carry any attack that hits Gyarados hard--the\nexception being the rare Rock Slide--but despite Taunt, it can beat\nGyarados one on one with Drill Peck or Hidden Power Flying. However, it\nshould beware of the occasional mixed or special Gyarados. If Gyarados\nlacks special attacks or Taunt, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and phazing moves\nwill prevent it from sweeping. Weezing can be a prick to Gyarados in a\nsimilar vein to Skarmory. It can Will-O-Wisp Gyarados and Haze away its\nDragon Dance boosts; if Gyarados has Taunt, Weezing can always Sludge\nBomb, as repeated Sludge Bombs will eventually bring Gyarados down. If\nneeded, it can even pack Thunderbolt to defeat Gyarados. Once again, as\nwith Skarmory, Weezing does not like special attacks. Donphan can\ncomfortably take several physical assaults, then Roar away Gyarados or\nhurt it with Hidden Power Rock or Rock Slide. It is easily dispatched by\nSurf or Hydro Pump, though. Although it is UU, Solrock is another decent\ncounter to Gyarados thanks to STAB Rock Slide, along with a resistance\nto Hidden Power Flying and an immunity to Earthquake. Don't have it try\nto take a Surf or Hydro Pump though. Porygon2, Starmie, and Regice also\nsurvive Gyarados's attacks easily to counter with decently powerful\nThunderbolts.</p>\n<p>Choice Band Gyarados is best handled by prediction and capitalizing on\nthe resistances of Pokemon such as Metagross, Zapdos, and Skarmory.\nFlail variants can get shut down by Tyranitar's Sand Stream, as well as\npriority. The special attacker is completely shut down by Lanturn, who\nnot only packs STAB Thunderbolt, but is itself immune to Electric thanks\nto Volt Absorb, and further resists Water, Ice, and Flying attacks. Most\nother Electric-types, such as Raikou, Jolteon, and even Ampharos, can\nswitch in and take out Gyarados with Thunderbolt. Zapdos must watch out\nfor Blizzard or Ice Beam, though.</p>\n<p>Gyarados can also fall easily to a surprise Electric-type move, such as\nForretress's Zap Cannon. Claydol and Vaporeon are good users of Hidden\nPower Electric as they aren't hit hard by Gyarados's other moves, and\naccomplish something aside from hitting Gyarados. It lets Claydol hurt\nSkarmory, and enables Vaporeon to counter other bulky Waters more\neffectively.</p>\n",

Flamethrower and Fire Blast are both decent STAB moves that separate it from the other Rock-types in the tier, targeting the foes that it normally walls on their generally lower Special Defense. Toxic spreads status and is Magcargo's best way of crippling the bulky Water-types that are sure to switch into it. RestTalk is recommended on this set to give Magcargo as much longevity as possible and allow it to absorb Sleep Powders and other status from the Grass-types it easily walls. When taking this route, pairing Magcargo with a Heal Bell user like Chimecho would be wise to wake it quickly. Toxic can be replaced with Yawn and pairs well with Magcargo's defensive nature by forcing a switch and giving Magcargo's team some momentum.</p>\n<p>Sassy is the chosen nature to not lower the power of Self-Destruct or Flamethrower, and the slightly lower Speed stat is not an issue due to Magcargo's already snail's pace. A mixed defensive EV spread is doable; a spread of 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with the Defense investment preventing the 2HKO from a +2 Adamant Mawile's Hidden Power Steel while still allowing Magcargo to avoid the 2HKO from 252 SpA Modest Chimecho's Psychic. Generally, however, the additional Special Defense is preferred to allow Magcargo to beat Plusle one-on-one, and Magcargo OHKOes Mawile with Fire Blast anyway (though not with Flamethrower).</p>\n<p>Magcargo surprisingly has a number of viable move options not listed above that can be tailored to meet the needs of your team. If running RestTalk doesn't suit your taste, Protect pairs best with Toxic to allow for residual damage buildup and additional Leftovers recovery, as well as allowing Magcargo to scout Choice Band attackers' attacks. That said, Protect's utility can be forgone in favor of additional coverage from Hidden Power Grass, which gives Magcargo some modicum of defense against the other Rock-types in the tier beyond status and will deal a ton of damage to the likes of Whiscash. Self-Destruct is pretty weak compared to the other boom attacks in the tier due to Magcargo's paltry Attack stat, but it's still a good way of crippling opposing Pokemon and allowing Magcargo to keep momentum for its team and prevent Pokemon like Huntail from freely setting up on it; obviously, this should only be run when not using RestTalk. Light Screen and Reflect are both available, with Reflect notably allowing Magcargo to avoid the OHKO from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Earthquake 75% of the time. Light Screen may be more handy overall, though, as with max Special Defense investment and behind a Light Screen, Magcargo is only 3HKOed by defensive Dewgong's Surf. Hidden Power Water can be used over Hidden Power Grass, which trades the ability to batter Whiscash and Relicanth for the ability to threaten other offensive Fire-types like Charmeleon. Both Toxic and Yawn can be used on the set at the same time, allowing Magcargo to literally pick its poison for the enemy between those two moves and its ability, Flame Body; however, doing so can leave Magcargo completely helpless against Substitute users.</p>\n<p>Spikes support is very effective with this set due to the status and switches it forces, and Roselia has fantastic type synergy with Magcargo, though using both will create a large Ground-type weakness that can be hard to fill. Still, a switch-in to Ground-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks is needed when using Magcargo, making physically defensive Swalot, Pelipper, and Whiscash good teammates. Water-types are particularly dangerous to the success of this set, making defensive Bellossom and Kecleon good teammates as well. Finally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate Magcargo's ability to wall both Fire- and Flying-types should be used with it, examples including Tangela, Piloswine, and Venomoth.</p>\n"

Unfortunately, its Attack stat is abysmal, meaning it can't really make use of its Rock STAB or access to Self-Destruct to the fullest. That said, its Special Attack is above average, and its STAB Fire Blast will hurt a lot of the tier.

Offensive Water-types such as Seadra and Huntail will easily outspeed and OHKO Magcargo with Surf, but they need to be mindful of status and Self-Destruct. Other Rock-types, such as Sudowoodo and Graveler, resist Fire Blast and Self-Destruct and will easily OHKO Magcargo with Earthquake, but they will be whittled down by Toxic over time if they're not careful.

The Fire moves can OHKO Scizor / Forretress and are\nan alternative to Ice Beam for dealing with Grassers.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>Slowking usually needs max HP because he will be taking both physical and special attacks. Optionally, you could go with 16 Speed EVs, that way you outrun anything you paralyze.</p>\n<p>Set #1 (Calm Mind) needs a lot of Defense to make Calm Mind work, the leftover EVs in Special Attack.</p>\n<p>A must in set #2 (Focus Punch) is to have at least 210 Attack (stat) to dent Blissey. Anything you have left is for Special Attack.</p>\n<p>Set #3 (Curse) obviously has a lot of Attack and Special Defense, the opposite of set #1.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Depends highly on the set, there is no 100% counter. Snorlax is the\nsafest bet. Raikou, Zapdos, Jolteon, Blissey, Regice, Swampert,\nGyarados, Celebi, Vaporeon, Porygon2, Heracross, and Venusaur can work.\nIn UU, Electabuzz, Lanturn, Meganium, Pinsir, Quagsire and Manectric.\nWhile nothing is a complete stop to all sets, Slowking won't have as\nmuch of an impact with his surprises as something like Gengar or\nAlakazam.</p>\n",

Sludge Bomb is Golbat's main STAB attack, hitting Grass-types very hard and neutral targets for good damage. Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB Flying-type attack to allow Golbat to run Hidden Power Ground. Hidden Power Ground hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Golbat usually struggles with. Toxic allows Golbat to put a foe on a timer, wearing down potential walls that might switch into Golbat. Whirlwind phazes the opposing Pokemon, resetting stat boosts and potentially revealing more of your opponent's team. Taunt can be used to prevent setup and other status moves, and can potentially allow Golbat to outstall certain Pokemon like Sableye by blocking its use of Recover. Giga Drain is an option to hit Relicanth, Pupitar, and Graveler harder than Hidden Power Ground would. Protect over Hidden Power Ground is an option that allows Golbat to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, which greatly increases longevity, as Hidden Power Ground isn't doing much to common Steel-types without the power of Choice Band behind it. The given EV spread maximizes HP and has enough Speed investment to make Golbat outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan, with the rest of the EVs thrown into Attack to boost Golbat's offensive potential.</p>\n<p>This Golbat set can be used to switch into Fighting-types more liberally, having the passive recovery of Leftovers to help it out. Golbat can also be used to deal with Grass-types, which usually rely on their STAB moves to defeat foes. Golbat can switch into powerful Earthquakes from many Pokemon, but because many Ground-type Pokemon are also Rock-type, Golbat needs to make use of effective double switching to get in a teammate that can take on these Pokemon one-on-one.</p>\n<p>Golbat appreciates teammates that can deal with Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types. Whiscash, Hitmonchan, and Graveler are particularly good partners to perform this task. Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Dewgong, Seadra, and Mawile can cover Golbat's Ice weakness. In return, these Pokemon like the removal of Fighting-types, which Golbat does well. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela help eliminate Rock- and Ground-types that wall Golbat. Diglett can remove Rock- and Steel-types, particularly Mawile, which Golbat has significant trouble playing around without good prediction.</p>\n"

Golbat's base 80 Attack is decent, especially given its powerful physical STAB attack in Sludge Bomb. However, Golbat struggles to deal with the multiple good Rock-types that are in the tier. It also struggles with Steel-types, especially Mawile, as it forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground and even then can become setup fodder that allows Mawile to Baton Pass to a teammate.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A set utilizing Screech is a good option to help Golbat wallbreak, being able to 2HKO even the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier with neutral attacks. More importantly, it allows Golbat to be able to beat Sableye easily late-game. It also forces a lot of switches, making Golbat pair nicely with Spikes support. A bulky set with Substitute can be used to help ease prediction. An even more bulky EV spread can be run to check the likes of Hitmonchan more effectively, but this takes a lot away from Golbat's offensive presence. Haze can be run to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Golbat, and Thief can be used to cripple Pokemon dependent on Leftovers as their source of recovery. Curse is an option for Golbat to set up itself, but it reduces Golbat's appealing Speed that makes Golbat a popular option. Sunny Day can be used to set up sun for another Pokemon to take advantage of while also removing rain to prevent Huntail and Swift Swim Relicanth from utilizing it.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Mawile is immune to Golbat's STAB Sludge Bomb, resists Aerial Ace, and forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground to even hit it for chip damage. Even Choice Band Golbat will do less than 40% to Mawile with Hidden Power Ground, letting it set up for almost no cost and then Baton Pass the boosts and possibly a Substitute to one of its teammates. Sableye completely walls the Choice Band set, as Golbat cannot 2HKO it with any move, and Sableye only fears Toxic from the bulky Leftovers set. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Graveler resist both of Golbat's STAB attacks and can punish back with a super effective Rock Slide, but the latter two must watch out for a potential Giga Drain. While it can't take a Hidden Power Ground well, Plusle will always have at least one chance to KO even bulky Golbat from full health, so you need to predict well when anticipating it to come in, as it will almost always force Golbat out. Pikachu is also a potential revenge killer that forces a Speed tie with Jolly Golbat. Poison-types such as Swalot and Arbok check Golbat well, and Chimecho fares well against it unless Golbat is holding a Choice Band.</p>\n",

Giga Drain is a great attack to\nnail Swampert, who can be problematic due to its bulk and immunity to\nThunderbolt. However, Will-O-Wisp can be used in its place, as Giga\nDrain has little use outside of Swampert, who is crippled by Will-O-Wisp\nanyway. Will-O-Wisp also shuts down other physical attackers, such as\nTyranitar and Metagross, both of whom Gengar is otherwise virtually\nuseless against.</p>\n<p>A myriad of choices are available in the last slot. Hypnosis is the\npreferred option as it allows Gengar to put one Pokemon to sleep and\nessentially render it useless; its terrible accuracy is its main\ndrawback though. Destiny Bond is very useful in the last slot, as it\ngrants Gengar one last kill as it is taken down. It can also give Gengar\nfree turns during which it can attack, spread burns, or switch out for\nfree, as not many players will attack it after it has used Destiny Bond.\nExplosion lets Gengar go out with a bang; it is particularly useful\nagainst Blissey and Snorlax, both of whom otherwise wall Gengar.</p>\n<p>188 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Gengar outrun the likes of Jolly\nFlygon, Timid Jirachi, and +1 Tyranitar, while HP EVs allow it to\nsurvive the occasional gentle breeze.

Make sure to use a Hasty nature and move the HP EVs to\nAttack if using Explosion; this will let it do about 80-90% to both\nSnorlax and Blissey, KOing them after minor prior damage.</p>\n<p>Blissey takes pathetic damage from Gengar's attacks and can cripple it\nwith Thunder Wave, as well as heal burned or sleeping teammates with\nAromatherapy. Celebi is 3HKOed by Ice Punch, but can Recover off damage,\nset up with Calm Mind, and OHKO Gengar with Psychic; to top it all off,\nneither of these Pokemon are crippled by status due to Natural Cure.\nStarmie and Raikou can easily switch in on Ice Punch and Thunderbolt\nrespectively, then outspeed and KO Gengar. Adamant Dugtrio can trap and\nkill all of the aforementioned Pokemon, as well as Magneton, which is\nthe only Pokemon that resists all of Gengar's attacks.</p>\n<p>Taunt is an unexpected move that can turn the tables on some of Gengar's\nmost common counters, such as Blissey, Snorlax, Regice, and Zapdos.\nGengar should attempt to burn these Pokemon as they switch in, then when\nthey attempt to use a recovery or status move, Taunt them to prevent it,\nand switch to an appropriate counter or attempt to finish them off. The\neffectiveness of this strategy is a lot greater if you have Spikes\nsupport and sandstorm to wear down the aforementioned Pokemon's HP.\nDestiny Bond can also be used in conjunction with Taunt to force the\nopponent to use an attacking move, thus taking the foe down when Gengar\nis KOed.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Perish Trapping Gengar is often unexpected and can turn the tables on\ntypical Gengar counters. The idea of the set is to use Mean Look as a\nGengar counter such as Blissey or Snorlax switches in and trap it, then\nuse Perish Song to KO it. Substitute effectively provides free turns at\nthe cost of a quarter of Gengar's HP. After two turns, Gengar switches\nto an appropriate switch-in, scoring a free KO on the trapped opponent.\nDestiny Bond is used in the final moveslot to let Gengar take out\nanother Pokemon after successfully Perish Trapping something. It should\nonly be used as a last resort, such as when Gengar has lost most of its\nHP from making Substitutes. Taunt can be used instead of Substitute to\nstop attempts at crippling Gengar with status moves or phazing it, but\nProtect must then be used in the final moveslot as Gengar needs free\nturns to pull off the strategy. Hypnosis is an alternative to put the\ntrapped Pokemon to sleep, rendering it useless as Perish Song takes\neffect. However, its low accuracy makes it a risky option.</p>\n<p>This bulky EV spread allows Gengar to survive dangerous moves such as\nCelebi's Psychic and Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying, as\nGengar is vulnerable while it sets up Perish Song. With 80 Speed EVs and\na Timid nature, Gengar has over 300 Speed, allowing it to outspeed a\nvast number of Pokemon and use Substitute to provide free turns for\nitself. Its Speed stat should not be maximized though, because bulk is\nthis set's main priority.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of trapping, Dugtrio makes an excellent teammate\nbecause of its Arena Trap ability. Dugtrio can reliably trap and KO\nPokemon with Perish Song if Gengar is KOed before Perish Song has fully\ntaken effect. However, Dugtrio will need the otherwise slightly gimmicky\nSubstitute or Protect in its movepool. Dugtrio can also assist against\nStarmie, Raikou, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, all of which are\nproblematic for Gengar.</p>\n"

Because of its versatility and great\ncoverage, Gengar is very difficult to properly counter once it is on the\noffensive. Gengar also has a wide variety of support moves at its\ndisposal, ranging from status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Hypnosis,\nto Destiny Bond and Perish Song.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Choice Band Gengar is a gimmicky option, but an option nonetheless, as\nit has two strong physical STAB attacks in Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball.\nThis set can do serious damage to Pokemon that normally counter Gengar,\nas Blissey and Snorlax are nailed by Focus Punch, and Celebi by Sludge\nBomb. Once the opponent discovers the set, however, Gengar can be easily\ncountered and will often end up resorting to Explosion quite quickly.\nShadow Ball used to be a common move for dispatching of Celebi and other\nGengar. Sludge Bomb is the only other physical move worth using on\nGengar, as it dents Blissey for about 25-30% and has a chance to poison.\nThis will force Blissey to resort to using Soft-Boiled, which is when\nGengar can hit her with Focus Punch for the 2HKO. Gengar can run a mixed\nset with both special and physical attacks, but this would be less\neffective overall due to the split EVs. Additionally, it would run into\nserious issues with Metagross and Jirachi, and is generally not\neffective in this metagame. Taunt is an option to prevent Snorlax and\nBlissey from healing, and becomes a decent option with some HP EVs and\nSpikes support.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Blissey can come in on most Gengar sets with ease; special attacks do\nvirtually nothing to it, and Natural Cure makes status moves\nineffective. That said, it is usually wise to switch out to a sleep\nabsorber on Hypnosis to activate Sleep Clause. Curse + RestTalk Snorlax\ncan set up on Gengar without fear of Will-O-Wisp; the standard RestTalk\nRegice is a solid Gengar counter as well. Teams that use resistances to\ndefend against strong special attackers will often have to figure out or\nguess Gengar's set first, as it is very versatile.</p>\n<p>With some careful playing, Calm Zapdos will usually be able to switch\nin; Ice Punch deals considerable damage, but Gengar will usually lose\none-on-one. Celebi can take on Gengar well thanks to Recover and Calm\nMind, as Gengar won't usually risk staying in and taking Psychic.\nJirachi works in a similar way, except it takes less damage from\nThunderbolt than Celebi takes from Ice Punch. Bulky Sleep Talk Tyranitar\nand Metagross can usually switch in on Gengar easily--McIceGar isn't\nthat common, so Tyranitar is usually safe. With maximum HP and some\nSpecial Defense investment, these Pokemon can reliably shut Gengar down.\nTyranitar will also be able to trap and eliminate Gengar with Pursuit.</p>\n<p>Raikou is a good counter too, because it doesn't take much damage from\nThunderbolt or Ice Punch, and can outspeed and do around 70% damage to\nGengar with Thunderbolt; it should be wary of an incoming Hypnosis or\nWill-O-Wisp though. Rest + Sleep Talk Raikou, though situational, is a\nhard counter to Gengar. Dusclops is in the same boat; Rest + Sleep Talk\nsets will easily switch in on Gengar, but the Pain Split variant should\nwatch out for status.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set is one of the best blanket checks in the NU metagame, in particular being a fantastic answer to the omnipresent Hitmonchan. With the given EV spread, Chimecho avoids a 2HKO from non-Choice Band Hitmonchan's Hidden Power Ghost and Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck, and it survives even Huntail's Modest rain-boosted Hydro Pump at full health. Besides being a great check to a multitude of threats in the tier, this set also supports the team in multiple ways, including crippling troubling defensive threats like Sableye with Toxic, healing status on your own Pokemon with Heal Bell, and buffering attacks with a screen of choice to make setup easier for a teammate. Yawn is a good choice to force switches or put a foe to sleep, which when combined with screen support can create a very good setup opportunity for a teammate. As a support Pokemon, this Chimecho set fits on a wide range of teams, with stall teams finding its access to Heal Bell almost invaluable and offensive teams appreciating its ability to pivot around Hitmonchan and other threats.</p>\n<p>Chimecho is highly flexible in its EV spread and move choices; it all comes down to what gaps you want Chimecho to fill on your team. More Defense EVs can be added to let Chimecho more reliably answer Hitmonchan and other offensive monsters like Pupitar. Alternatively, Chimecho can add more Special Defense investment to let it take on special attackers like Haunter, as Chimecho's resistance to Fighting allows it to check Hitmonchan reliably enough with just maximum HP investment.</p>\n<p>There's a ton of move choices that can be added and swapped around, all with their own perks and downsides over the moves listed. Icy Wind can allow Chimecho to lessen the threat of a Pokemon like Raticate that it wouldn't be able to KO with Psychic before being KOed itself. Chimecho can set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day to allow a weather sweeper like Huntail or Bellossom come in and start wreaking havoc. Finally, Taunt or Torment can allow Chimecho to effectively stallbreak when combined with Toxic and Heal Bell.</p>\n<p>Being able to check Hitmonchan is one of the biggest draws to using Chimecho, and using it to fill a Hitmonchan weakness is one of the easiest ways to fit it onto teams. There are some great defensive cores that Chimecho fits on to fulfill this purpose, such as with Kecleon and Relicanth or Mawile and Flareon. As a support Pokemon, Chimecho should be used to patch weaknesses in your team and its goal is not to sweep itself, but there are a few Pokemon to keep in mind that Chimecho simply can't touch with this set, most notably Steel-types like Metang and Dark-types like RestTalk Sableye. Flareon is a particularly useful partner to ensure these Pokemon don't become too problematic, and on stall teams, Wish Flareon + Sableye + Heal Bell Chimecho is one of the sturdiest defensive cores in the metagame. Finally, a dedicated sweeper like Huntail, Tangela, or Dragon Dance Pupitar should be paired with Chimecho in some manner, as it can protect their vulnerable defenses with a screen of choice and heal any status they may accrue with Heal Bell.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Chimecho has many fantastic qualities of a late-game sweeper with great bulk, few weaknesses, good resistances, access to a great boosting move, and a reliable enough mono-STAB attack. Relying on just Psychic to sweep is doable in NU thanks to the general lack of Dark-types aside from Sableye, and only one of the three common Steel-types (Metang) can take repeated blows from this set. Thanks to RestTalk, Chimecho also doesn't care too much about status, allowing it to steamroll stall teams as a last Pokemon if they lack Perish Song. In the mid-game, Chimecho also has utility as being one of the best Hitmonchan checks in the tier, and thanks to Calm Mind, Chimecho can throw out some decent hits with a boosted Psychic to help secure a sweep.</p>\n<p>44 Speed EVs are run to outspeed minimum Speed Dewgong, with the rest of the EVs invested in making Chimecho as physically defensive as possible, as it will be boosting its Special Defense through Calm Mind to make up for the lack of investment. With the given defensive investment, Chimecho just barely avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth's Rock Slide and at +1 avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump out of rain. While focusing on Defense investment is probably the better route to take, focusing on Special Defense is an option and can make Chimecho nearly impregnable from the special side. With full Special Defense investment and at +1, Chimecho avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump in the rain, quite the major feat for a Pokemon that doesn't resist Water.</p>\n<p>This set requires some team support to work, as there are a few key threats that need to be removed before trying to sweep. This set works best against slower stall teams that lack a way to break through it outside of status, with the only major roadblock on these teams being Sableye. Pokemon that can lure in Sableye and remove it are the best partners to this set, and this includes Hitmonchan with Toxic, mixed attackers like Crawdaunt and Seviper, and super strong physical attackers like Choice Band Graveler and Piloswine. The other common Dark-type to be wary of is Murkrow, which is significantly easier to lure in and remove than Sableye due to its frailty. Other major threats that need to be removed are strong physical attackers that can 2HKO Chimecho, which includes Choice Band users, such as Raticate, Pidgeot, and Flareon. Having a super defensive teammate like Relicanth that can tank attacks from these threats and remove them is necessary.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set makes Chimecho as dangerous as possible as quickly as possible, pressuring the opponent and making it hard to switch into thanks to a good amount of power and awesome coverage. Psychic + Hidden Power Fire gets incredibly good neutral coverage in NU, with Hidden Power Fire getting a much needed super effective hit on two of the three Steel-types in Metang and Mawile, as well as a decent hit on most the dangerous Dark-types in the tier, particularly Sableye, Murkrow, and Cacturne. While Hidden Power Fire is preferred for its greater super effective coverage, Hidden Power Electric gets better neutral coverage with Psychic and is Chimecho's best weapon against the Dark-types, in particular gaining super effective hits on Murkrow and Crawdaunt. The last slot goes to the move that best supports Chimecho's team, and there's a few different choices for the last slot that each have a lot of merit. Reflect protects Chimecho from Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmonchan and Shadow Ball from other physical attackers like Raticate and Vigoroth, allowing it to beat them one-on-one. Heal Bell allows Chimecho to steamroll through defensive teams that rely on Toxic to beat it, as well as supporting the team and helping RestTalk users. Finally, Yawn can completely cripple a Pokemon on the opponent's team or force switches, allowing Chimecho more time to gain boosts with Calm Mind.</p>\n<p>There's quite a few directions you can take Chimecho's EV spread in, with the given one making Chimecho as powerful and bulky as possible while outspeeding minimum Speed Dewgong. Running max Speed investment with a Timid nature is an option that allows Chimecho to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonchan and outrun Timid Tangela before it can hit Chimecho with Sleep Powder. Another option is running more defensive investment to make Chimecho more of a tank, but that's generally done better when using a RestTalk set. If you need Chimecho to check Huntail, 252 HP and 80 SpD EVs need to be run to avoid the OHKO from Hydro Pump in the rain. For alternate move choices, Hidden Power Ice is an option in the second moveslot to gain a super effective hit on Ground-types, but it comes at the cost of losing the super effective hit on Steel-types. Hidden Power Dark actually provides the best neutral coverage for Chimecho, and it gains a super effective hit on opposing Chimecho and Abra. Substitute is a fantastic move to protect Chimecho from status conditions and can be very difficult for the opponent to play around once Chimecho racks up a couple of Calm Mind boosts. Shock Wave can be used in the last slot alongside Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Dark to increase Chimecho's coverage as much as possible, although Chimecho benefits from the ability to support its team with this set.</p>\n<p>Spikes support is great with this set to pressure the opponent and push foes into easier KO range, particularly specially-weaker Pokemon like Piloswine and Graveler. Even without much defensive investment, Chimecho is a great answer to Hitmonchan, making Mawile and Kecleon ideal offensive partners to capitalize on this fact. Pokemon that can switch into the physical attacks that will be thrown at Chimecho make the best teammates for this set, Relicanth and Sableye in particular being good examples. Offensively, Murkrow is a great partner for Chimecho as it switches into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks easily despite its frailty and is extremely dangerous for Bellossom and Cacturne, both of which can interrupt a sweep from Chimecho.</p>\n"

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Chimecho's movepool is pretty expansive, but most of the notable examples have been mentioned already. Chimecho can fit Rain Dance and Sunny Day on any set pretty easily to support a weather-sweeping teammate. Skill Swap can be used to really mess with certain threats like Flareon and Huntail, allowing offensive Chimecho to even countersweep Huntail's team if done correctly. Psych Up can prevent Calm Mind Sableye from using Chimecho as complete setup bait. Curse can be used on Chimecho's Calm Mind sets to make it super hard to break both physically and specially--it just can't make use of the Attack boosts that come with it. Icy Wind is an interesting option to slow down certain threats like Vigoroth before Chimecho is KOed, allowing a teammate to more easily revenge kill it. Nightmare can be paired with Hypnosis, and in general is a fun move to mess with the large amount of RestTalk users in the metagame.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Metang is probably the best all-around answer to Chimecho thanks to its 4x resistance to Psychic, neutrality to Hidden Power Electric, and immunity to Toxic. It can easily remove Chimecho with Explosion or whittle it down with Meteor Mash faster than Chimecho can wear it down; however, it needs to be wary of Hidden Power Fire. Dark-types are also very good switch-ins to Chimecho as they are immune to Psychic. Cacturne is probably the best example, as it also resists Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Dark and easily 2HKOes Chimecho with Hidden Power Ghost. Murkrow and Crawdaunt also easily 2HKO Chimecho with Shadow Ball and Crunch respectively, although they need to be very wary of Hidden Power Electric. Calm Mind Sableye can use most of Chimecho's sets as setup bait and eliminate it with Hidden Power Dark, though it really doesn't like Toxic unless it's running RestTalk. Mawile and Lairon can switch into Chimecho if needed and blast it with their STAB moves. While Chimecho is decently bulky, it falls short of avoiding 2HKOes from the hardest hitters in the tier, with strong Choice Band attackers like Raticate, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, Piloswine, and Flareon all being able to easily 2HKO even the most physically defensive Chimecho if it isn't behind a Reflect.</p>\n",

Substitute or Spore when you can to buy a little more\ntime, and Endeavor anything you can. Due to Smeargle's extremely low HP,\nall bar immune opponents will be put straight into Sand Stream's KO\nrange. The last move finishes these foes off, and all others if\nsandstorm isn't up. While Dragon Rage does more damage, Extreme Speed\nstops Salac-boosted Pokemon at 1 HP from ruining this set; it'll be\ndoing about 2 HP damage to most Pokemon. This set is extremely deadly,\nespecially if your opponent doesn't wise up to the fact that it is level\n5 and switches in its sleep absorber without realizing that everything\nis faster and powerful enough to KO it.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to switch this Smeargle in is by pairing it with\na Pokemon with both a trapping and a sleeping move; Mean Look + Lovely\nKiss Jynx, Block + Yawn Snorlax and Mean Look + Hypnosis Gengar are all\ngood options. Smeargle essentially needs one turn to switch in and one\nto set up with Spore or Substitute. If you ever encounter something that\ncannot really touch him, such as a Pokemon with no attacking moves or\nonly Ghost-type moves, use that to switch Smeargle in more than once.</p>\n<p>Smeargle's EV spread and hold item will likely not matter. One thing to\nnote, though, is not to give Smeargle HP EVs when running this set; this\nwill reduce Endeavor's damage. In fact, you'll want to set its HP IV to\n9 or less. This gives it 20 HP, which is the minimum possible. Defensive\nEVs, on the other hand, are helpful on this set because this Smeargle's\nHP is low enough that it can KO most anything with sandstorm damage, so\nit doesn't need to take any more damage than sandstorm will inflict.\nMeanwhile, the defensive EVs might help Smeargle, unlikely as it is,\nsurvive something.</p>\n"

Xatu's Attack isn't\nmuch worse than its Special Attack, so you could try out physical\nattacks on it, but then you're just a worse Fearow except for your\nFighting resist. Xatu can use Hidden Power Ice to get a surprise OHKO on\nGligar, something Hypno and Grumpig can't do without taking a Swords\nDanced hit, and Gligar might expect Ice Punch from them and switch out,\nanyway.</p>\n<p>Rest can be used with the Trait Early Bird to make Rest last a single\nturn, or you can use it with Synchronize to switch into status,\nSynchronize it, and then Rest off the status later, and when you wake\nup, Xatu can Synchronize someone else. This is probably best done with a\nSleep Talk set, however, so Xatu isn't completely a sitting duck while\nit's Sleeping. Thunder Wave or Toxic can be added on as status.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>Xatu should go to 310 Speed max, as that will make Xatu faster than neutral nature Scyther, Electabuzz, and Manectric, as well as Jolly Kangaskhan and Timid Pikachu; this requires 224 Speed EVs and a +Speed nature. 301 Speed makes it faster than Jolly Hitmonlee, Adamant Fearow, and neutral nature Tentacruel, as well as Jolly Gligar; this requires 192 EVs and a +Speed nature. 280 Speed beats Adamant Kangaskhan and Modest Pikachu; Xatu needs 216 EVs and a neutral nature to reach this. The lowest most Xatu should go is probably 270 Speed, to beat Adamant Gligar; this needs 176 EVs and a neutral nature.</p>\n<p>Supporter Xatu should max HP, and put the rest in Special Attack, whereas sweeper Xatu should do the opposite--max Special Attack, and put the rest in HP.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>OU counters: Snorlax, Regice, and Blissey will easily stop any special\nset, and won't take enough damage from a physical hit if you try and run\na Choice Band Xatu for the surprise factor to make it worth it. Xatu can\npotentially use Wish and Calm Mind to actually beat Blissey, unless it\nhas Toxic, or can Calm Mind itself, but even Thunder Wave will ruin\nXatu's chance at a sweep when they just bring in a physical attacker and\nOHKO you. Tyranitar and Metagross laugh at anything Xatu can throw at\nthem, except Dragon Dancing Tyranitar won't like Thunder Wave. Raikou,\nZapdos, and other Electric Pokemon can do more damage than Xatu can\ndefend against with Calm Mind and Wish. Any physical attacker that isn't\nweak to Psychic can put the hurt on Xatu, really.</p>\n<p>UU counters: Manectric, Electabuzz, and other Electrics can damage Xatu\ntoo fast, just like in OU. Solrock and Lunatone laugh at anything Xatu\ncan throw at it, save Hidden Power Dark, and even that won't do enough\nto counter Solrock's Rock Slide or Shadow Ball. Aggron doesn't care\nabout Thunder Wave that much, resists Psychic and Hidden Power Dark, and\nhas STAB Rock Slide to annihilate Xatu. Sableye is immune to Psychic and\ncan hit Xatu hard with STAB Shadow Ball or Feint Attack. Banette OHKOs\nXatu with Shadow Ball, but doesn't have the Special Defense to switch in\nthat often. Kangaskhan takes very little from Xatu's attacks, and can\njust beat it down with STAB Return or Shadow Ball, and, if it is abusing\nEarly Bird Rest, you can't even cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hypno and\nGrumpig can just come in and Calm Mind up with you, and they will win\nthe Calm Mind war most of the time, especially if they have Ice Punch or\nThunder Punch.</p>\n",

Deoxys-S gets Light Screen, Reflect, and\nSafeguard, and it has the Speed to use any of these. Substitute is an\noption for most Pokemon, but especially things with a lot of Speed, and\nthis Pokemon is all about the Speed. Rock Slide works if you are lucky\nand want to flinch, as Deoxys-S is fast enough to flinch anything, and\nit hits both Ho-Oh and Rayquaza. Pursuit is available for other\nPsychic-types, especially Deoxys-A, but it needs to be used carefully,\nas some of those Pokemon can do some damage to Deoxys-S if they know it\nhas Pursuit and stay in (you need 172 Special Attack EVs to have a\nchance to OHKO and 248 Special Attack EVs and a +Special Attack nature\nto always OHKO a Deoxys-A that stays in). Snatch always allows for some\ncreativity, so don't be afraid to get creative with Deoxys-S.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>For most sets, you'll want to get to 440 Speed to be faster than +Speed Deoxys-A, which requires 16 Speed EVs and a Speed boosting nature or 176 EVs and a neutral nature. Offensive sets should go for maxing the attacking stats, and defensive sets should max HP and then focus on the defenses.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The most reliable counter is probably Forretress. It can Rapid Spin away\nSpikes, is immune to Toxic, doesn't take much from physical attacks,\ndoesn't take much from special attacks except Thunder and Fire Punch,\nand can easily 2HKO with STAB Hidden Power Bug. Tyranitar and Snorlax\nbeat Deoxys-S that lack Superpower. Blissey can stop anything without\nTaunt or Superpower. Groudon with max HP is rarely 2HKOed by Ice Beam,\nand it can OHKO or 2HKO back with Earthquake (guaranteed OHKO if it is\nChoice Banded). Kyogre 2HKOes Deoxys-S with Surf even if it gets a Calm\nMind in (it OHKOes otherwise), but it is 2HKOed by Thunder after\nDeoxys-S uses Calm Mind. It won't take much damage from anything else,\nhowever. Latias and Latios can Calm Mind up against any special attacker\nand easily beat it with their high Special Defense, but hate Knock Off\nvariants. Ho-Oh beats any Deoxys-S that does not have Rock Slide.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Murkrow's STAB Drill Peck is, undeniably, one of the best moves in a tier where Hitmonchan, Grass-types, and Bug-types abound. What's more, it's powerful enough to 2HKO 252 HP Piloswine and OHKO Raticate when boosted by a Choice Band, indicating its pure unadulterated power. Hidden Power Ground takes out the Rock- and Steel-types bold enough to try stepping into the path of Murkrow's Drill Peck, easily 2HKOing Sudowoodo, Lairon, Metang, and Graveler after a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Ground is preferred to Hidden Power Fighting for its super effective hit on Poison-types, particularly Swalot, but Hidden Power Fighting offers a super effective hit on Normal-types and doesn't let the multitude of Ground-immune Pokemon switch in for free. Shadow Ball and Double-Edge are largely filler but can be used as safety moves when you're unsure of which way your opponent is going to go. Shadow Ball is particularly nice for its super effective hit on Chimecho and neutral hit on Rock-types.</p>\n<p>A Jolly nature is absolutely needed to not only get the Speed tie with other Murkrow and Pidgeot but also outspeed the base 90 Speed tier, which notably includes Venomoth and Vigoroth. Dropping down to Adamant gives Murkrow more power, but losing those Speed ties and getting outsped by positive-natured base 80s like Glalie is a death wish. Sharp Beak can be used to bluff a Choice Band while keeping high power on Drill Peck and gaining the ability to switch moves, although the drop in power on its other moves is super noticeable. There are only two notable move changes to consider on this set. The first is replacing Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting with Hidden Power Grass and using a Naughty nature, as doing so gives Murkrow an easy way to blow past its biggest nemesis in Relicanth along with Graveler and Whiscash. Hidden Power Ground will be better most times, however, particularly against the likes of Mawile and the other Steel-types. The second is Pursuit, which can be used effectively in the last moveslot over Double-Edge when you know your opponent is going to switch, in particular being a nice tool for Chimecho; just be sure to change Murkrow's nature to Naughty when doing so. Pursuit is a terrible move to be locked into, though, so it's recommended to only use it with Sharp Beak.</p>\n<p>Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into 2HKO range, particularly the Rock- and Steel-types weak to Hidden Power Ground, and the only Pokemon that can really tank attacks from Murkrow are grounded (Pelipper being about the only exception). Due to this, Glalie and Cacturne make exceptional offensive Spikes partners to use with Murkrow, and both have an easy time OHKOing the Rock-types that can withstand Murkrow's attacks.</p>\n<p>Murkrow is a great counter to the defensive Grass-types in the tier and a great check to the offensive ones, meaning Rock- and Water-types such as Sudowoodo and Seadra appreciate having Murkrow as an offensive teammate to eliminate them. Murkrow also generally has an easy time with Chimecho, if it avoids Hidden Power Electric anyway, meaning Hitmonchan likes having Murkrow as a teammate too. Loading on Choice Band users on your team is a good strategy when using Murkrow, as very little in the tier can take on that kind of onslaught, particularly if Murkrow is used with its partner in crime Pidgeot.</p>\n<p>Defensive Relicanth and Mawile are probably the best switch-ins to Murkrow, with the former only really fearing Hidden Power Grass and the latter weakening Murkrow with Intimidate. Due to this, Murkrow absolutely needs teammates that can reliably switch into these Pokemon and try to eliminate them. If your prediction is good, Diglett is an almost surefire way of trapping and getting rid of Mawile. Otherwise, a Grass-type like Tangela has a very easy time with Relicanth and other Rock-types, while Fire-types like Torkoal can switch into Mawile with impunity and force it out with Fire Blast. Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Murkrow, so bringing something to absorb Electric attacks is a good idea; Grass- and Ground-types being good general partners to do so.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Murkrow is one of the most simple, yet one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the NU metagame. An extremely high Speed stat, STAB Drill Peck, and really high Attack when combined with a Choice Band give it an incredible offensive presence on the battlefield. While it's extremely similar to Pidgeot, which even boasts the same Speed stat, Murkrow has a slightly better typing, ability, and overall coverage than its brother-in-wings. Insomnia makes Murkrow a golden answer to a majority of the Grass-types in the tier (though it needs to be really wary of Stun Spore), and its Dark typing means it can get a free switch into Chimecho's STAB Psychic and threaten it back with Shadow Ball. While it is much, much frailer than Pidgeot, and its STAB Drill Peck is leagues weaker than Pidgeot's Double-Edge, there's still very little risk to using Murkrow.

Thunder Wave can cripple a switch-in, but most Pokemon that will be switching into Murkrow are super slow already. Perish trapping the opposing Pokemon is an option, but Murkrow hardly lacks the bulk to effectively pull this off in any capacity. Finally, Calm Mind is there, but Murkrow's strongest STAB move, Faint Attack, is horribly weak even at +1, and Murkrow has no coverage other than Hidden Power.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The number one counter to Murkrow is defensive Mawile. Intimidate removes Hidden Power Ground as an effective answer to it, and in return, Mawile can slap Murkrow around with Hidden Power Steel or use Murkrow as setup bait. Defensive Relicanth is a close second, though it fears Hidden Power Grass more than it would like. That said, nothing else from Murkrow is going to leave a lasting scratch on it. Other Steel- and Rock-types, such as Metang, Lairon, Graveler, and Sudowoodo, are great answers to Murkrow, though they all have to be more wary about Hidden Power Ground, especially if Spikes are on their side of the field.</p>\n<p>Apart from those that resist Drill Peck, generally physically bulky Pokemon like Piloswine can tank an attack and easily KO Murkrow back; other examples of which include Whiscash, Wailord, Dewgong, and Swalot. Plusle and Haunter cannot switch into Murkrow safely, but they outspeed Murkrow and easily OHKO it with Thunderbolt, and Raticate does the same with Double-Edge.</p>\n",

Imprison\ncan prevent opponents from using Rest or a status move, while Snatch\ngrabs useful support effects such as Blissey's Soft-Boiled. Counter can\nlet Dusclops catch some threats, such as Curse Snorlax and Choice Band\nGuts Heracross, off-guard. Hidden Power Flying can be used if you\ndesperately need a Heracross counter, and it also helps against Breloom\nand Machamp.</p>\n<p>There are two main advantages to using Rest over Pain Split: in addition\nto healing it fully, Rest also cures Dusclops of status. Pain Split, on\nthe other hand, heals Dusclops without putting it to sleep, and will\nalso lower the opponent's health. It can even bring the likes of Blissey\nand Snorlax to well below 50%, and almost fully heal Dusclops when used\nagainst most healthy enemies. However, Pain Split will not be as\neffective against weakened opponents. With Pain Split, Dusclops will\nalso find it difficult to actually KO its opponents, because it will be\nworn down alongside them, and its low Speed leaves it unable to deal a\nfast final blow. Rest is also the better move for PP stalling, which\nDusclops does very well with its high defenses, access to Will-O-Wisp,\nand Pressure ability. Additionally, Pain Split doesn't remove status.\nSome Claydol carry Toxic, so Dusclops will likely need Rest or cleric\nsupport to reliably block Rapid Spin for long. Even if using Rest,\nthough, Dusclops appreciates cleric support, as it removes the biggest\nproblem of Rest: the two turns of sleep.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Houndoom can come in on Will-O-Wisp or Shadow Ball easily and has both\nCrunch and Pursuit; the former hurts Dusclops if it stays in and the\nlatter if it switches out. Tyranitar has to avoid Will-O-Wisp at all\ncosts, but he can Substitute or Taunt, Crunch for a load of damage, or\nset up Dragon Dance boosts. Both of these are taken care of by a swift\nFocus Punch, however.</p>\n<p>Skarmory doesn't take much damage from physical assaults, and is not\n3HKOed by Seismic Toss or Night Shade. A burn reduces Skarmory's damage\noutput, but most of the time he will handle the damage just fine, and\ncan set up Spikes in the meantime. Suicune survives five Seismic Tosses,\nand can Calm Mind up and KO with Surf. Milotic can switch in on\nWill-O-Wisp to activate Marvel Scale, and use either Toxic or Hypnosis\nto cripple Dusclops. Milotic cannot outright KO Dusclops, though.</p>\n<p>Guts Pokemon, namely Heracross, Ursaring, Swellow, Hariyama, and\nMachamp, can take advantage of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Although their best\nSTAB attacks won't work well--or at all--on Dusclops, their coverage\nmoves nonetheless do a number on Dusclops; they can then proceed to\nclean up the rest of your team.</p>\n",

One of the most common Hidden Power types seen on Unown other than Psychic is Hidden Power Fighting, which in just about any other metagame would make sense, as it super effectively hits Dark-types that would use Hidden Power Psychic Unown as setup fodder. However, two of the best Dark-types in NU, Murkrow and Sableye, are neutral or immune to it. Other Hidden Power types that threatening Pokemon such as Vigoroth and Flareon might be immune to, including Ghost and Fire, are not recommended. All physical variants of Unown should move the Special Attack EVs into Attack, change the nature from Modest to Adamant, and equip Unown with a Choice Band. Chimecho is a worthwhile replacement for your Unown team slot, as they both have Levitate, and Chimecho has better base stats than Unown in all departments except for Attack, which neither one uses on their primary set. Abra is a frailer alternative to Unown that gives up a type immunity for blazing Speed and extraordinary Special Attack.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Dark-types such as Poochyena and Carvanha completely wall Hidden Power Psychic, Ghost-types such as Shuppet and Duskull wall Hidden Power Fighting, and Normal-types such as Igglybuff and Azurill wall Hidden Power Ghost.

          "description": "<p>This set combines all of Cacturne's best aspects to get as much mileage out of it as possible. The main reason you'd use Cacturne over Glalie or Roselia as a Spiker is that Cacturne is significantly harder to switch into, and with a wide array of coverage moves available, Cacturne ensures just that with this set. Giga Drain or Needle Arm should be used as Cacturne's primary STAB move. Giga Drain offers passive recovery, which can let Cacturne take on Water- and Rock-types slightly better, while Needle Arm has far more PP and has a chance to flinch the target. Hidden Power Dark is recommended as a secondary STAB move, and Dark-type attacks are hard to come by in the tier, which allows Cacturne to act as one of the few decent checks to Chimecho. However, Hidden Power Psychic can be used instead to nail Hitmonchan looking for a free switch in to spin away Cacturne's Spikes, and it also gets a decent hit on the Poison-types in the tier.</p>\n<p>Destiny Bond is a great tool for ensuring the opposing Pokemon goes down with Cacturne, and Cacturne is one of the few with access to the move in the tier. As a bonus, it may also scare the opponent into switching the next turn, freeing up time for Cacturne to lay another layer of Spikes. Because Cacturne is rather slow, Destiny Bond is kind of hard to use effectively or consistently, which is why Thunder Punch is also suggested in the last slot. Normally, Murkrow and Pidgeot have a fairly safe switch into Cacturne, but Thunder Punch ensures that that is not the case, OHKOing the former and easily 2HKOing the latter.</p>\n<p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Cacturne to outrun maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar, with the rest of the EVs pumped into Special Attack so that Cacturne hits as hard as possible. A special attacking set is preferred due to Cacturne's STAB types being special. As for other move options, Toxic is a decent option for crippling Hitmonchan and bulkier walls like Lickitung and Kecleon. Different Hidden Powers can be used depending on your team's needs, but Dark and Psychic are by far the most useful.</p>\n<p>Teams that don't want to use Glalie because of its typing and don't like Roselia because of its physical frailty will really like Cacturne. While it's frail both specially and physically, its resistances allow it to stand up to some attacks the other two cannot. Cacturne fits best on heavy offense teams since it doesn't last long itself but is capable of dishing out a ton of damage. Unfortunately, Hitmonchan probably has the easiest time switching into Cacturne out of the Spikers and can either easily OHKO it with Sky Uppercut or spin away Cacturne's Spikes. To combat Hitmonchan, Haunter and Chimecho are recommended as teammates, and they have decent synergy with Cacturne outside of checking Hitmonchan. Murkrow and Pidgeot easily switch into anything apart from Thunder Punch and threaten to KO Cacturne with their Flying-type STAB moves, making Rock-types like Relicanth and Sudowoodo and Steel-types like Mawile good teammates. Rock-types also make good use of the Spikes Cacturne sets up and lure in bulky Water-types, which Cacturne can then easily switch into and threaten out.</p>\n"

Running a Grass- or Dark-type STAB move in the last slot is an option, but they're pretty weak with an Adamant nature and no investment, even with Cacturne's high Special Attack stat. Other physical move options include Brick Break and Double-Edge for a strong, reliable attack when without a Substitute. Glalie is an ideal teammate for this set, as Cacturne forces a lot of switches between Focus Punch and Leech Seed or Destiny Bond, and Spikes helps capitalize on those forced switches.</p>\n<p>This set can lure in and take out common switch-ins to Cacturne like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, meaning Pokemon that can sweep with their removal are good teammates. Rock-types, Pupitar in particular, love having Hitmonchan out of the picture. Hitmonchan of your own and Chimecho love having Murkrow and Pidgeot out of the way. This set is probably the best switch-in to Chimecho in the tier, particularly Calm Mind variants, as most don't carry a move that can hit Cacturne effectively, while Cacturne can easily 2HKO Chimecho by targeting its weaker defensive stat. This fact further increases the synergy between Cacturne and Hitmonchan and also makes Cacturne a valued teammate of Poison-types like Haunter and Arbok. Finally, this set is totally walled by Swalot, making Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates as well.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set combines Cacturne's good offensive presence and its ability to set Spikes, disrupt the opponent's team, and force switches. In order to get the best out of this set, switch in on a foe using a setup or status move like Reflect and use Encore on it. From there, set up Spikes, or if you can predict what Pokemon your opponent is going to switch to, use the appropriate STAB move. Hidden Power Dark is more useful than Needle Arm for its broader neutral coverage, higher power, and ability to rip apart Chimecho and Haunter. The best options over Needle Arm are Leech Seed and Substitute, both of which best utilize the switches Encore will force and can lead to even more switches by the opponent.</p>\n<p>The Speed EVs outspeed minimum base 60 Speed Pokemon and max Speed Adamant Sudowoodo as a bonus. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to give Cacturne a bit of bulk, and Special Attack is maxed out to make use of Cacturne's Special Attack as best as possible. However, the EVs as a whole are pretty flexible, and EVs can be moved from Special Attack or Speed to the defenses to better cushion common attacks Cacturne resists like Earthquake and Surf.</p>\n<p>As a support Pokemon, this set is less dependent on having teammates that support it, but having teammates that can capitalize on the Spikes Cacturne provides is important. Offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot, Raticate, Hitmonchan, and Vigoroth are good examples of Pokemon that make use of Spikes and enjoy having Cacturne's offensive presence on the team to remove problematic Pokemon like Rock-types and Chimecho. Cacturne also has an easy time switching in on defensive Pokemon like Whiscash and Lickitung and forcing them out with Encore, making it a good partner for Fire-types and special attackers like Plusle.</p>\n"

On top of that, it has amazing mixed attacking stats and a decent offensive typing. With that said, it doesn't have a solid STAB move that can make use of its great attacking stats. What's more, it is very slow, extremely frail, and has an awful defensive typing in a tier dominated by Fighting-, Poison-, and Flying-types. Still, it has a lot of perks over Glalie and Roselia, and since Spikes is the only form of entry hazards in NU, you'll probably make a team with Cacturne on it at some point.</p>\n",

Counter is a good option for surprising an opponent using a non-super effective STAB move, but without Focus Sash in ADV it's really hard to pull off with Cacturne's frailty. Finally, Toxic and GrassWhistle are options as status moves, but Leech Seed or Encore will generally be more useful than either of those two.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Murkrow has an exceptionally easy time switching into Cacturne, as it resists both of Cacturne's STAB moves, resists Hidden Power Ghost, only really fears Thunder Punch or Focus Punch, and immediately threatens Cacturne with Drill Peck. Pidgeot can similarly switch in and threaten Cacturne with Aerial Ace, but it can't switch in quite as safely as Murkrow. Hitmonchan easily annihilates Cacturne with Sky Uppercut and resists Hidden Power Dark; it even spins away Cacturne's Spikes. Flareon can easily tank anything from the special attacking sets and can eliminate Cacturne with Fire Blast.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Swalot fears almost nothing from Cacturne and even enjoys switching into Leech Seed because of Liquid Ooze. Venomoth isn't even fazed by Cacturne's Grass-type attacks nor Focus Punch and threatens Cacturne with Sludge Bomb in return.

Volt Tackle can give you some extra power,\nbut it can't be used with Surf.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>233 Attack with Focus Punch to 2HKO Blissey in standard. 299 makes you tie with most Salamence for Speed, and 328 makes you faster than stuff like Modest Gengar and the like. Put leftover EVs in Special Attack. When not using Focus Punch, just make sure to max Special Attack for maximal sweeping power.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>In standard, Venusaur and Celebi can come in easily on Thunderbolt,\nHidden Power Grass, Surf and Focus Punch, taking nil damage thanks to\nLeftovers and Recover, Leech Seed and / or Synthesis. Even Hidden Power\nIce doesn't do that much. Dusclops with around 360 Special Defense can\ntake quite a few Thunderbolts from Raichu if it can Pain Split or Rest\nin time, and is immune to Focus Punch, while Hidden Powers and Surf\ndon't do much damage. Blissey, Snorlax and Regice must avoid Focus Punch\nat all costs, so they cannot come in effectively on a Substitute Raichu\neither, but the rest of its moves don't do much at all. Snorlax might\neven be able to come in on Substitute and Curse up and come out on top,\nbut beware of Raichu using Encore.</p>\n<p>Grounds can be used for countering Raichu to an extent. Flygon needs to\nbeware of Hidden Power Ice, and doesn't take Focus Punches too lightly\n(especially if Flygon is Choice Banded and thus lacks Leftovers\nrecovery), but makes an excellent counter nonetheless because of a\nguaranteed OHKO with its STAB Earthquake. Claydol is immune to\nThunderbolt and resists Focus Punch, but is 3HKOed by Surf and almost\n4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Ice. It is hard for Raichu to get around\nClaydol though, since Raichu will have to predict it switching in every\ntime. Donphan is easier to beat but is still a hindrance; it takes\nnearly no damage from Focus Punch thanks to its high Defense, but Surf\nand Hidden Power will 2HKO him. Swampert is 2HKOed by Hidden Power\nGrass, but every other attack does absolutely nothing to it.</p>\n<p>In UnderUsed, Camerupt can be almost completely disregarded as a counter\nbecause of Surf. Vileplume and Meganium, much like Venusaur and Celebi,\ntake nearly no damage from Focus Punch and Thunderbolt and can shrug it\noff with Leech Seed and Synthesis. They should watch out a little more\nfor Hidden Power Ice, though. Quagsire and Whiscash do the same job as\nSwampert: countering any variant not using Hidden Power Grass with no\ntrouble at all. That's why Vileplume or Meganium combined with Quagsire\nor Whiscash walls any Raichu available. Sandslash and Gligar do the same\nas Donphan here: being 2HKOed by Surf (and in Sandslash' case, Hidden\nPower) doesn't cut it, but easily take Focus Punch and Thunderbolt for\nbreakfast. Hypno and Grumpig, the standard special walls of UU, do quite\nnicely at taking anything Raichu throws at them, though Grumpig has no\nWish like Hypno does, so it will get worn down quickly. A sweeping\nGrumpig doesn't like to get Thunder Waved either.</p>\n<p>In general, attacking Raichu straight on is a good idea if it doesn't\nOHKO you. It's very fragile and weak to the most common attacking move\nin the game (Earthquake), and it often uses Substitute to see what\nyou're going to do. Just switching out if it comes in on your\nnon-attacking move is handy as well, since it is probably going to use\nEncore.</p>\n",

Hidden Power Flying rounds off the set by giving Aerodactyl\na strong secondary STAB move that is useful against Celebi, Breloom, and\nMachamp.</p>\n<p>Choice Band is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl can sweep late-game.\nThe EV spread listed takes full advantage of Aerodactyl's excellent\noffensive stats; max Attack is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl is\nhitting as hard as possible, and max Speed is needed to outspeed\neverything with the exception of Jolteon and other Aerodactyl; the IVs\nensure that Aerodactyl can Speed tie with opposing Aerodactyl and\nJolteon when using Hidden Power Flying. An EV spread of 32 HP / 248 Atk\n/ 8 SpD / 220 Spe is another viable option; this spread allows\nAerodactyl to take a Thunderbolt from Gengar while still being able to\noutspeed Timid Raikou and Starmie.</p>\n<p>Aerodactyl really appreciates Spikes support to turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs,\nlike against Suicune and Milotic. A specially defensive Skarmory makes\nfor a great partner, as it can switch into a lot of the Pokemon that\nswitch into Aerodactyl, such as Metagross, Suicune, Milotic, Swampert,\nand opposing Skarmory. Pokemon that can lure out and weaken or take out\nAerodactyl's checks are also fine partners. Tyranitar is one of the\nbetter offensive partners for Aerodactyl, as it can deal huge chunks of\ndamage to many of Aerodactyl's checks and can also negate their\nLeftovers recovery with Sand Stream. Metagross shares good defensive\nsynergy with Aerodactyl and can take out Skarmory and bulky Water-types\nwith Thunder Punch and Explosion, respectively. Zapdos and Celebi are\nalso great partners due to their ability to force out bulky Water-types,\nensuring that Water-types have to step on Spikes one more time if they\nwant a chance to beat Aerodactyl.</p>\n<p>Aerodactyl really shines on offensively based Explosion teams. Prominent\noffensive Explosion users such as Metagross and Snorlax can defeat or\nseverely weaken most of Aerodactyl's checks, as most teams can't handle\nmore than one Explosion. After Water-types are eliminated, Dugtrio can\ntrap and defeat weakened Normal-type resists, such as Jirachi and\nMetagross, increasing Aerodactyl's chances to sweep later in the game.\nIt's important to remember that Aerodactyl really doesn't need too much\nsupport, as it can cut through most teams with a lucky flinch; thus,\nSpikes are probably Aerodactyl's best partners as it supports both\nAerodactyl and the entire team. Once again, specially defensive Skarmory\nis an excellent Spikes user alongside Aerodactyl. Speaking of Spikes,\nbulky Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar with maximum Special Attack EVs not\nonly blocks Rapid Spin, but also has the potential to defeat Suicune and\nMilotic, both of which are common Aerodactyl switch-ins.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is one of the most feared Choice Band users in OU. Its access\nto unresisted coverage moves in Rock Slide, Double-Edge, and Earthquake\nallow the prehistoric tyrant to ravage the OU metagame. Aerodactyl's\nsecondary Flying typing blesses it with an immunity to Earthquake, and\nmore importantly Spikes, allowing it to hit hard throughout the match.\nFinally, as if it could get any better for Aerodactyl, it's tied for the\nfastest Pokemon in ADV OU with Jolteon, who is OHKOed by Earthquake.\nDespite all of these strengths, Aerodactyl is not without some serious\nintrinsic weaknesses. Aerodactyl's weakness to Ice Beam, Surf, Rock\nSlide, and other common moves in the ADV OU metagame prevent it from\nswitching in as often as one would hope. Additionally, Aerodactyl's\ndefenses are far from stellar; even non-STAB super effective moves will\ndo significant damage to Aerodactyl, if not knocking it out. Don't let\nthese flaws deter you from using Aerodactyl because, if played to its\nstrengths, Aerodactyl will cut through teams like a hot knife through\nbutter.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Aerodactyl has a pretty big movepool, but should really stick with the\ngiven set. The only other viable set would consist of Rock Slide,\nEarthquake, Double-Edge, and Substitute with a Liechi Berry and an EV\nspread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 SpD. This set takes full advantage of\nAerodactyl's ability to force switches and hit hard behind a Substitute.\nToxic can be used over Double-Edge to cripple incoming Water-types; if\nusing Toxic, be sure to use Pressure as Aerodactyl's ability. Fire Blast\nmight seem useful to roast Skarmory, but Aerodactyl can beat Skarmory\nwith Rock Slide. Taunt might also seem viable, but that would mean\nforgoing the necessary Choice Band for the mediocre Leftovers. If using\nAerodactyl, it's best to stick with a Choice Band or a Substitute set.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Aerodactyl is hard to counter, as it can strip away a win from you with\nan untimely flinch. However, Aerodactyl does have a good amount of\nchecks. Metagross and Jirachi can switch into Aerodactyl's STAB moves\nand retaliate with Meteor Mash or Thunderbolt and Ice Punch,\nrespectively. Jirachi deserves a special mention, as it can set up\nReflect and Wish, further aiding your team by lessening Aerodactyl's\nsweeping prowess. However, Wish + Reflect Jirachi is not a better check\nto Aerodactyl, as Jirachi will lose super effective coverage due to\nReflect. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert can\ntake any one attack from Aerodactyl and return the favor with a STAB\nSurf or Hydro Pump. Physically defensive Celebi can switch into any of\nAerodactyl's moves bar Hidden Power Flying and set up Calm Mind or Leech\nSeed.</p>\n<p>On more offensive teams, Intimidate is a great way to lessen\nAerodactyl's sweeping prowess while giving your own team a chance to\nsweep. Great examples of viable Intimidate users are Salamence and\nGyarados. It's worth noting that Salamence and Gyarados share excellent\ndefensive synergy with Jirachi and Metagross. Salamence and Gyarados can\nswitch into Aerodactyl's Earthquake which was meant to hit Metagross or\nJirachi, set up a Dragon Dance, and proceed to sweep. Claydol can take a\ncouple of Aerodactyl's hits in the early-game and retaliate with Ice\nBeam; however, Claydol is sure to lose in the late-game due to its lack\nof reliable recovery. Although Flygon can't switch into Double-Edge,\nhaving a Rock-type resistance is necessary to prevent Aerodactyl from\nrunning through your team. Also, Flygon pairs well with Metagross and\nJirachi, ensuring that you have an offensive core that will give\nAerodactyl trouble due to Flygon's and the aforementioned Steel-type's\nexcellent defensive synergy. Skarmory can switch into any of\nAerodactyl's moves, set up Spikes, and Rest off any damage taken. More\nuncommon checks to Aerodactyl include Donphan and Steelix. Steelix in\nparticular can take on Aerodactyl throughout the game due to its\nresistance to most of Aerodactyl's moveset and its excellent Defense\nstat. Remember that an untimely flinch can spell doom for your\nAerodactyl check, so it's a good idea to have two Aerodactyl checks, or\nat least two Pokemon that can take a hit and OHKO Aerodactyl before it\nruns through your team. A fine example of this is a bulky Gengar capable\nof taking Rock Slide and hitting back with Thunderbolt.</p>\n",

Overheat lets Arcanine\ndispatch Skarmory, which would otherwise wall this set, while\nDouble-Edge is Arcanine's most powerful physical move. As Arcanine's\nmovepool is so limited, it can use Hidden Power Grass over Iron Tail to\nOHKO Golem, and run Double-Edge in the third slot. However, Arcanine\nwould then lose a lot of power against Slowbro and Slowking.</p>\n<p>Again, maximize Attack, and run some Speed as well. 244 is a good Speed\nstat to hit, as it beats all Tyranitar; 263 beats all Magneton,\nSkarmory, and Solrock, and 265 beats most Gyarados. Put the rest in HP\nfor optimum bulk.</p>\n"

Counter is a great addition to the sweeper set,\nas it allows Sandslash to destroy many of the Grass-type Pokemon which\nnormally stop it, since their strongest move is Hidden Power Grass,\nwhich can be Countered. The basic strategy is to bring Sandslash in on a\nweak physical attack such as Rock Slide, or any Electric attack. Swords\nDance on the switch and then start sweeping. This set allows you to take\nout Blastoise, Walrein, and Meganium - all common switch-ins to\nSandslash -and continue sweeping what you can. Greedy Gligars also get\ntaken out it they try to KO with only +2 or +4 Atk (depending on EVs and\nnature of the Gligar).</p>\n<p>Another bonus is that with the 252 HP EVs, and 36 SpD EVs you always\nsurvive various STAB Surfs and Ice Beams, while being faster and being\nable to 2HKO. For example, you can Swords Dance on your opponent's\nswitch to Walrein or Blastoise, and then hit it for a 2HKO with Rock\nSlide (only on Walrein) or Earthquake, and live through the Surf / Ice\nBeam to hit them for the KO. Additionally, Sandslash will always survive\na Timid Manectric's Hidden Power even after a Petaya boost, as well as\nalmost always surviving a Timid Electabuzz's Ice Punch after a Petaya\nboost.</p>\n<p>Rock Slide is the preferred move in the 4th slot, because it has the\nflinch rate, and Sandslash is able to outspeed most walls. It also\nallows Sandslash to take out fliers and Levitators that would not take\nthemselves out with Counter, such as Misdreavus and Xatu, but more\nimportantly, Altaria (which is outsped by this variant of Sandslash,\nallowing you to Rock Slide and possibly flinch before you get hit with\nHaze or Perish Song). Furthermore, it helps with Scyther and Yanma, not\nallowing them to set up while you try to Counter. Hidden Power Bug hits\nGrass types that do not attack with Hidden Power Grass, such as Bellosom\nand Tangela, and can hit Meganium hard if it uses Light Screen or Leech\nSeed. Hidden Power Bug also hits Solrock / Lunatone for super effective\ndamage. Hidden Power Ghost, on the other hand, hits not only the\npreviously mentioned Lunatone / Solrock for super effective damage, but\nalso Misdreavus and Xatu as well. Counter takes care of Fearow, so it is\nnot a big trouble if it walls those two attacks. It should be noted,\nhowever, that Rock Slide does have lower accuracy than Hidden Power</p>\n"

Sandslash makes an\naverage Sleep Talker thanks to his great defense, but you'll be wasting\nhis awesome Swords Dance potential, and the most common Sleep moves come\nfrom Milotic, Jynx and Grass-types, none of which Sandslash likes to\nface.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>It outspeeds Blastoise with no Speed EVs, with the recommended spread, as well as anything slower (Hypno, Solrock, and anything else with 70 base or lower). You'll generally want a ton of Attack, with the rest of the EVs in HP.</p>\n<p>If you're using Counter, you may want to take EVs from Attack and Speed and put them into HP.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Its biggest weakness is that it's slow and doesn't take special hits\nvery well, but most special attackers do not take his Earthquakes that\neasily either.</p>\n<p>In standard, Skarmory walls Sandslash to an extent. Toxic will mess it\nup badly, Spikes will hurt the team and Roar and Whirlwind negate Swords\nDance. However, Sandslash can also Rapid Spin off the Spikes, and hit\nSkarmory with a Swords Danced Focus Punch, or try to wear it down with\nRock Slide (Swords Danced Rock Slide does about 40%). Suicune, Milotic\nand Swampert can OHKO with Surf or Hydro Pump, and their high HP and\nDefense will be troublesome in the early stages. If their health falls\nbelow 50%, however, a Swords Danced Earthquake will kill all three of\nthem (except a Bold max Defense max HP Suicune, who has a chance to\nsurvive). Salamence and Gyarados can be a pain with Intimidate and\nimmunity to Earthquake, but unless they're using a Special Attack like\nHydro Pump, Sandslash can just Swords Dance on the switch and beat them\nwith Rock Slide. Claydol is immune to Earthquake and resists Rock Slide,\nand usually packs Toxic or a super effective Ice Beam, however he is\n3HKOed by Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug without Swords Dance.\nZapdos and Raikou, as well as other Special Attackers that outspeed\nSandslash, can come in on a non-attacking move or after Sandslash killed\nsomething to finish it off.</p>\n<p>In UU, a Gligar with Counter or Toxic can mess up Sandslash somewhat,\nand Quagsire, Blastoise and Walrein can hold the boat to the same extent\nSuicune, Milotic and Swampert can in standard. Solrock can Reflect up\nand Lunatone can use Ice Beam, but they should beware of Hidden Power\nGhost or Hidden Power Bug. Any STAB Water, Grass or Ice attack will\n(nearly) kill Sandslash. Meganium makes a great counter with Giga Drain,\nRazor Leaf or Hidden Power Grass, perhaps in company of Reflect and / or\nLeech Seed, but once again watch out for Hidden Power Bug. Make sure to\nuse Synthesis to keep it alive.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Roselia is by far the easiest Spikes user to fit on your team in NU, and this set tries its best to reflect that. While Glalie is overall bulkier than Roselia, it has a far worse typing suited for defensive teams and lacks recovery, making Roselia much easier to fit on these types of teams. Roselia's usable movepool is also pretty deep, meaning there's a lot of different combinations of moves you can use here and still remain effective at what Roselia sets out to do: mainly, set up Spikes. Synthesis is the biggest move that sets Roselia apart from Glalie and Cacturne and is highlighted here, allowing Roselia to effectively check certain special attackers like Bellossom, defensive Wailord, Plusle, and Haunter not carrying Psychic throughout the match. Protect makes a decent alternative to Synthesis and pairs well with Toxic to build damage, scout Choice Band users' moves, and stall for Leftovers recovery. If you choose Toxic for the third moveslot it'll likely end up as Roselia's main method of damage, as it is Roselia's best tool for Flareon and other defensive threats looking to switch into Roselia for free. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can be used in the third slot if you require Roselia to better check Mawile and Bellossom and prevent the opponent from using Roselia as setup bait. The last slot goes to Roselia's STAB move of choice. Giga Drain makes use of Roselia's great Special Attack and allows it to effectively check the Pokemon it needs to, particularly Huntail. If the PP is off putting to you, Magical Leaf is a decent alternative.</p>\n<p>Near-maximum Special Defense investment is needed so that Roselia has the best possible chance of checking Huntail, as even with full investment Timid Huntail still has a ~3% chance of 2HKOing Roselia with Ice Beam. Roselia's physical defense is so paltry that most investment there is wasted. For example, at maximum Defense Roselia will still take 38.8 - 45.7% from an unboosted Adamant Hitmonchan's Earthquake. However, with 20 Defense EVs, Roselia can avoid some OHKOs, particularly from Piloswine's Earthquake and Pidgeot's Aerial Ace. 32 Defense EVs can be run to avoid a 2HKO from Hitmonchan's Rock Slide. Roselia's Speed is decent, so some investment there could be worth it, but there are no major benchmarks worth investing for except for Flareon and Dewgong, both of which will cream Roselia regardless. If running Speed, a more offensive set can be run that forgoes any bulk at all and focuses on Roselia's great Special Attack stat. A spread such as this is mostly outclassed by Cacturne and to a lesser extent Glalie, but it can be very effective at luring in opposing Roselia and other common checks such as Golbat and eliminating them with the appropriate move.</p>\n<p>As stated before, Roselia's movepool is pretty deep, so there are some niche options worth careful consideration over the options listed above. Sludge Bomb makes a decent attacking alternative to Giga Drain despite Roselia's low Attack because of the high poison chance it possesses and the fact that most of the Pokemon that are likely to switch into Roselia have lower Defense than Special Defense. Hidden Power Water is Roselia's best attacking move for Flareon, but it'll still do pitiful damage if you're not running a lot of Special Attack. Hidden Power Psychic will do a lot of damage to the Pokemon that can normally switch into Roselia for free, such as Golbat, Swalot, and opposing Roselia. Stun Spore can severely cripple some of the more offensive Pokemon looking to switch into Roselia for free and is a good tool to help support a slower sweeper of your own, such as Calm Mind Chimecho. Aromatherapy is a great move if using Roselia on a stall team as an alternative cleric to Chimecho. Leech Seed can make Roselia very hard for opposing defensive teams to take down, but it can leave Roselia walled hard by other Grass-types. Grass Whistle is Roselia's only method for putting the enemy to sleep, and while its accuracy is pretty shoddy, if you're using Roselia on a stall-centric team it should have a few opportunities to get Grass Whistle to connect. Finally, Rest is an acceptable alternative to Synthesis when used with Natural Cure, but the required switching to heal the sleep can spell doom if not used correctly.</p>\n<p>Roselia fits best on defensive teams, so naturally defensive Pokemon are going to make the best teammates. In particular, Roselia should be paired with Pokemon that can make the most of the Spikes that it'll set up. Phazers such as Wailord, Flareon, Piloswine, and Tropius should be top of the list for consideration when building a team with Roselia on it, as they can prevent setup sweepers from becoming too dangerous and rack up Spikes damage simultaneously. Physically defensive teammates such as Relicanth and Pelipper are needed to switch into the threats that can switch into Roselia without fear and force it out. Sableye in particular makes a fantastic partner to use alongside Roselia, as it counters many of Roselia's checks and has the added benefit of being able to spinblock to ensure that Roselia's Spikes stay on the opponent's side of the field.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Take one look at Roselia's learnset and one thing should scream out to you: Spikes. Combine that with a decent typing that allows Roselia to check two of the most threatening Pokemon in the tier in Huntail and Hitmonchan, a great Special Attack stat, decent Speed, and a deep supportive movepool, and it's easy to see why Roselia has a secure place in NU as a top-tier threat. While Glalie fits more offensive teams as a Spikes lead, Roselia fits better on balance and stall teams, which happen to be far more prominent in the metagame. So, what's the downside? In short: Roselia's frailty. While Roselia can get by with making smart switches to make use of its typing, its lack of bulk, especially physically, can get the better of it. Ultimately, Roselia's definitely worth bringing on any team you want Spikes on, and you definitely want Spikes on your team in this tier.</p>\n",

However, there are many prominent Grass-types in NU, meaning it'll very likely be completely walled in matches more than not. Psych Up is an option to allow Roselia to check certain Calm Mind sweepers such as Sableye, but Roselia naturally loses to the most prominent user in Chimecho. Finally, Growth can be used to make Roselia a bit of a self-sufficient sweeper, but Roselia's bulk is just not there to allow for consistent setup.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Hitmonchan can easily 2HKO Roselia with Earthquake and spin away Roselia's Spikes, making it the most prominent counter to consider when teambuilding. The number of spinners that threaten Roselia pretty much stops there, though, apart from Delibird, so the most effective way to limit Roselia's Spikes is to KO it as quickly as possible. Flareon can switch into anything Roselia throws at it except for Toxic and easily OHKOes Roselia with Fire Blast. Swalot utterly walls Roselia and even causes Giga Drain and Leech Seed to backfire thanks to Liquid Ooze. Flying-types, such as Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Golbat, fear little from Roselia's moves and easily OHKO it with their STAB moves. Other Grass-types with moves to hit Roselia super effectively, such as Hidden Power Fire Bellossom and Tangela, will easily tank anything Roselia throws at them save for Sludge Bomb, even being immune to Leech Seed. For the most part, physically offensive Pokemon like Raticate, Metang, Vigoroth, and Kingler will easily OHKO Roselia with their STAB moves or Double-Edge.</p>\n",

Its prime use\nis trapping Quagsire or some other slower Pokemon and then Exploding on\nit, but beware Damp or Protect Quagsire. Toxic can be used to wear\nthings like Meganium and Solrock down, but won't work if your opponent\nhas Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. Counter is a great surprise: Golem can\nsurvive many Earthquakes and Fighting hits to bounce them back for a\nquick KO. Roar is useful for Baton Pass chains.</p>\n<p>Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, and can\nfollow up with Rock Slide to lock them into paralysis and flinch until\nthey faint. Focus Punch can hit some things hard on the switch, but it\nhas the same power as Earthquake after STAB, so that won't generally do\nmuch for you.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>Just put a load in HP and Attack, and a little in Defense. Defensive Golem should use Impish, while Choice Banders can use Impish or Adamant. A little Speed can be welcome to Explode on slow stuff, though. 72 EVs is enough for most Vileplume. Trying to outspeed Solrock or Walrein isn't worth the investment.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Golem has trouble with Solrock. Levitate grants it immunity to\nEarthquake, and with stacked HP and Defense and a faster Reflect, it is\nnot easy to get past. Lunatone has less Defense, but the same typing and\nability as well as that super effective Ice Beam to watch out for.\nGrasses generally make Golem shiver with fear, especially those who have\nEarthquake resistance, like Meganium and Bellossom. Vileplume and\nVictreebel OHKO him with any Grass move as well, but they don't like\neating repeated STAB Earthquakes. Waters are a problem as well as that's\nGolem's secondary 4x weakness. Blastoise, Politoed and Poliwrath can all\ntake a beating and Surf or Hydro Pump away. Walrein is weak to Rock, but\nif it can get in on another move, Golem is still toast. Quagsire has the\nadvantage of the Rock resistance, and can also use STAB Earthquake or\nSurf, or Ice Beam. Misdreavus is immune to Double-Edge, Explosion, and\nEarthquake which is a great hindrance, especially for Choice Banders.</p>\n<p>Besides all this, any kind of decently powered special attack will\nreally mess up Golem, if it doesn't end up KOing him. Not all special\nattackers like to come into Golem Earthquakes or Rock Slides though.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Apart from its unfortunate weaknesses to Water and Ground, Golem is a\npretty decent Pokemon. This set capitalizes on Golem's ability to hit\nhard and take blows from the opponent's Pokemon with relative ease. It's\nnot the best Pokemon in the world, being partially outclassed by Rhydon\nand having pitiful Special Defense and abysmal Speed, but Golem can get\nthe job done regardless. Earthquake is the first STAB move of choice,\nboasting solid power and great neutral coverage. Rock Slide serves as\nGolem's secondary STAB and has great coverage with Earthquake, hitting\nSalamence, Gyarados, and the like hard. Additionally, it has a 30%\nchance to flinch, which is useful for defeating Snorlax and Forretress.\nGolem's two STABs form the QuakeSlide combination, which has, at the\nvery least, neutral coverage on pretty much everything not named\nClaydol, Flygon, or Breloom. Hidden Power Rock is an option over Rock\nSlide for its 100% accuracy, but the lack of a flinch chance makes it\ninferior to Rock Slide, not to mention that using it prevents the use of\nHidden Power Bug. Speaking of Hidden Power Bug, it provides crucial\ncoverage on Celebi, who could otherwise switch in with impunity.\nDouble-Edge is another possible choice, boasting decent coverage and a\nlack of recoil thanks to Rock Head. Double-Edge is generally the safest\nmove to go for in most scenarios as it prevents Salamence or Gyarados\nfrom switching in unscathed, unlike Earthquake. The last moveslot is\noccupied by Explosion, which enables Golem to KO most Pokemon that do\nnot possess a Ghost typing and gives it a way to actually do some damage\nto Skarmory and Swampert.</p>\n<p>With the given EVs, Golem can survive an Earthquake from Choice Band\nSalamence or +1 Tyranitar and outspeed Blissey and Swampert. The\nremaining EVs are invested in Attack and supplemented by an Adamant\nnature for maximum damage output.</p>\n<p>Golem needs a lot of support from its teammates to function effectively.\nIt can't do much damage to bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and\nMilotic, so Celebi is a great partner, as it has excellent type synergy\nwith Golem. Zapdos is another option to beat bulky Water-types and has\nan immunity to Golem's Ground-type weakness, which Celebi lacks. Do note\nthat Golem can damage bulky Water-types if it gets a chance to hit them\nmultiple times, but it won't be able to survive the turns it needs to do\nso. Spikes support is helpful to wear down Golem's switch-ins, so\nSkarmory and Forretress make great partners. Skarmory can switch in on\njust about every attack that threatens Golem, which is very useful.\nRapid Spin support from Forretress or Cloyster is recommended to prevent\nGolem from being worn down by Spikes, which is important because of how\neasily it is worn down without them. In a similar vein, Wish support is\nhelpful, replenishing the HP Golem loses to residual damage such as\nstatus conditions and Leech Seed. Blissey and Jirachi are the best\nchoices for Wish passing as they are both very bulky and can take on\nCelebi and the bulky Water-types that give Golem trouble; Blissey in\nparticular is well-suited for this role. Lastly, Skarmory is a massive\npain for Golem as it can set up the Spikes Golem dreads right in its\nface. For this reason, Pokemon such as Metagross with Hidden Power Fire\nor Thunder Punch, Fire Blast Snorlax, Hydro Pump Swampert, Choice Band\nAerodactyl, Choice Band Tyranitar, Fire Blast Salamence, or a Choice\nBand Fighting-type is recommended to take on Skarmory. The support that\nGolem requires is fairly substantial, as you can see, but it can work to\ndecent effect if you give it the support it desires.</p>\n"

Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock can\n3HKO it, however. Forretress lacks an immunity to Earthquake and is\nsimilarly troubled by the Choice Band set, but it can use Spikes and\nToxic as well. Also troublesome are defensive Water-types, such as\nSlowbro, Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert, all of whom can take an\nEarthquake or two and OHKO Golem with Surf or Hydro Pump.

Gengar can come in on anything that isn't a Rock move and use\nGiga Drain, Will-O-Wisp, or Ice Punch to beat Golem into submission.\nFlygon and Breloom will regret coming into Double-Edge, but they resist\nthe SlideQuake combination and have super effective STAB moves to wield\nagainst Golem. Celebi can Recover off the little damage it takes from\nmost of Golem's moves, especially a resisted Earthquake, and OHKO with a\nGrass move or 2HKO with Psychic.</p>\n",

While Shelgon's Defense is high, it has little in the way of a supportive movepool outside of Wish, but it certainly makes do with what it's got. The main reason you'd choose Shelgon over Lickitung as a Wish passer is its lack of Fighting weakness, while Shelgon's appeal over Flareon is its higher physical Defense and lack of Water and Ground weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Protect is super nice for scouting Choice Band attacks, racking up Toxic damage, and guaranteeing Wish recovery, but it can be forgone for Roar, which not only is rare in the tier but also prevents the opponent from using Shelgon as complete setup fodder. Roar also pairs nicely with the defensive nature of this set by exposing the opponent's team and racking up Spikes damage. Body Slam is pretty weak, especially without STAB or Attack investment, but it's nice for a chance to paralyze, which completely cripples a couple of the Pokemon Shelgon can wall, namely Pidgeot and Raticate. There's not a lot available that can go in its place; Dragon Claw is available and will get roughly the same amount of damage on targets with equal defenses like Pidgeot, but it lacks a paralysis chance, will be significantly weaker against specially defensive targets like Hitmonchan and Flareon, and still leaves Shelgon walled by Steel-types like Mawile; however, the higher damage against Rock-types like Sudowoodo could prove useful if your team is weak against them.</p>\n<p>While Shelgon's typing is better suited for a specially defensive set, as it resists key special types in Water, Fire, Electric, and Grass, it simply doesn't have the bulk to pull it off, so it's not a good idea to take Shelgon in that direction. Hidden Power Ghost can be used somewhere on the set to ensure that Haunter can't just switch into Shelgon for free, but Haunter isn't super hard to counter and Shelgon will normally be passing Wish to its teammates anyway. Switching up the set and replacing Wish and Protect with RestTalk is an option that gives Shelgon a lot of longevity, but Shelgon just doesn't have the defensive or offensive presence on the battlefield to really make it worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>Spikes support can really make or break the effectiveness of this set, making Glalie and defensive Roselia great teammates worth strong consideration. Bulky Water-types, particularly RestTalk Dewgong and Whiscash, will walk all over this set thanks to Ice Beam and the fact they won't mind being hit by status. Due to this, bulky Bellossom and offensive teammates to shatter these Pokemon such as Plusle and Haunter are needed. Chimecho with Taunt or Heal Bell can set up on this set pretty easily, making Dark-types good teammates as well.</p>\n<p>Finally, defensive Shelgon is best used in a defensive core with specially defensive teammates to cover those offensive Pokemon it cannot beat itself. Flareon stands out from the pack due to its access to Wish, resistance to Ice, and good synergy with Shelgon all around; the only issue with this core is the fact they are both weak to offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail. Other specially defensive candidates include Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which enjoy Wish support and Shelgon's ability to take on Hitmonchan.</p>\n"

It's also a very durable defensive option with access to Wish to keep it and its teammates healthy throughout the match. A huge weakness to Ice and being specially frail hurts it, though, and it lacks a usable STAB move. Still, for teams looking for a good surprise offensive or defensive option, Shelgon is certainly a viable candidate.</p>\n",

Hydro Pump and Fire Blast can both prove to be very useful on either the Dragon Dance or defensive set, with the former easily OHKOing Graveler and the latter 2HKOing Mawile, but the unique KOs they get pretty much stop there. Iron Defense can make Shelgon nigh untouchable physically and could make very good use of the last slot on the Dragon Dance set, but it does nothing to protect Shelgon from special attacks or critical hits. Finally, Shelgon has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, meaning it could be a useful defensive teammate to weather sweepers, especially when also running Wish.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Dewgong and Whiscash with Ice Beam, will prove to be the best switch-ins to Shelgon, with the former only being 2HKOed at best by any of Shelgon's attacks at +1, and the latter not even facing a 2HKO from Double-Edge at +2 (assuming it's fully physically defensive). Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail won't be able to switch in as easily, but they'll cleanly OHKO even defensive Shelgon with Ice Beam after a layer of Spikes. It should be mentioned here as well that Glalie will easily outspeed any Shelgon and cleanly OHKO it with Ice Beam as well.</p>\n<p>Mawile and Metang probably make the next best switch-ins, as they resist Double-Edge and won't take much damage from Brick Break or Hidden Power Ground. They do need to be careful of Shelgon just boosting in their faces, though, and they need to watch out for Fire Blast, but it's super rare on Shelgon overall. Defensive Tangela also avoids the 2HKO from Double-Edge even at +2, and it can hit Shelgon with Leech Seed and Stun Spore quite easily. Finally, any strong special attacker will be able to break through even defensive Shelgon without much trouble, including Haunter, Chimecho, Plusle with Hidden Power Ice, and Crawdaunt.</p>\n",

Of course, if\nthere are Spikes on Dugtrio's side of the field, it will have a bit more\ntrouble.</p>\n<p>Blissey and Snorlax can take repeated hits from Raikou and KO it with\nease. With Psych Up or Seismic Toss, Regice beats Raikou that lack Rest\none-on-one by virtue of its high Special Defense. If it lacks those two\nmoves, however, Raikou can set up with Calm Mind to the point where its\nSubstitutes are unbreakable. Celebi with Perish Song can easily force\nout Raikou and can set up Calm Mind alongside Raikou while taking very\nlittle from Raikou's common attacks. Venusaur that pack physical moves,\nsuch as Sludge Bomb, can beat Hidden Power Grass variants, as can\nFlygon. Swampert is OHKOed by +1 Hidden Power Grass and 2HKOed\notherwise, but it can switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO Raikou with\nEarthquake, as well as easily beat the less common Hidden Power Ice\nvariants. Steelix and Camerupt are immune to Thunderbolt and take\nneutral damage from both Hidden Power Ice and Grass and can hit Raikou\nback with STAB Earthquake. Claydol also packs an Electric immunity and a\nhigh Special Defense stat, but it's 2HKOed by +1 Timid Raikou.</p>\n<p>Although Marowak is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice or Grass, it can come in\non Substitute and KO Raikou with Bonemerang.

While it is not the best counter,\nMarowak is a very important threat to be wary of; do not assume your\nRaikou is safe behind a Substitute or that your set-up Raikou can OHKO\nit.

With 240 you will outrun Poliwrath, Lunatone and Solrock that do not use a +Speed nature (which is nearly always), so that's good to stick with. If you still want to go with a speedy Arbok, use 270 to outrun Nidoking without a +Speed nature.</p>\n<p>On a Choice Banded set, just max Speed and Attack and use Jolly. Killing is more important than surviving random hits.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Arbok is frail, so everything that uses Earthquake or Psychic instantly\nknocks him out.</p>\n<p>There are not many Steels to wall it, but plenty of Rocks and Grounds\nthat just as easily come in on Sludge Bomb and usually Earthquake. Main\ncounters include Solrock, Lunatone, Golem, Sandslash, Quagsire, Omastar,\nand Gligar, all of which resist Sludge Bomb and take little to no damage\nat all from its other moves, though all of these except Gligar do not\nlike Giga Drain much, and again Glare may hinder them. Iron Tail hits\nSolrock and Lunatone hard as well.</p>\n<p>Poison-types like Muk, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen can come in on Sludge\nBomb. Muk can Curse up and beat Arbok one on one, and Nidoking and\nNidoqueen can hit hard with STAB Earthquake. However, they fear being\nEarthquaked themselves. Arbok needs Hidden Power Ghost or Rock Slide to\ntouch Shedinja, so you can bring that in on the Choice Bander, or on the\nfirst set if it lacks Rock Slide for some reason.</p>\n<p>Kangaskhan can hit Arbok hard with Earthquake and will probably beat it\none on one, but it's not going to switch into these STABed Sludge Bombs.\nWhen facing Meganium using Arbok, always watch out for Counter.</p>\n",

It all comes down to the team Plusle is on and what threats are most dangerous that it needs to cover. In the end, though, the common Grass-types will likely be able to tank Hidden Power Ice, but in end-game scenarios, they should be sufficiently weakened enough to be KOed by it.</p>\n<p>Substitute takes advantage of the switches Plusle is likely to create, blocks status, and is a good way to Baton Pass into a teammate safely. However, Encore is a fantastic disrupting move if you predict a non-damaging move from the foe that can create opportunities for Plusle's teammates to switch in for free or force the foe to take more damage from Thunderbolt. The last moveslot needs to go to Baton Pass to allow Plusle to scout the opponent's switches and retain momentum in Plusle's favor throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Max Speed and a Timid nature are absolutely needed in order to Speed tie with other Plusle and Haunter and be able to outspeed Pidgeot and Murkrow. Running anything else is not at all recommended due to the importance of Plusle's Speed tier. Magnet is an option to boost the power of Plusle's STAB move a bit, in particular opening up a 2HKO on physically defensive Chimecho. Petaya Berry is another alternative item option with a boost that can be Baton Passed to a teammate as well. At +1, Plusle can easily 2HKO Roselia with Hidden Power Ice and OHKO even specially defensive Wailord with Thunderbolt.</p>\n<p>Fake Tears can be used to push a lot of switch-ins into the OHKO or 2HKO range, particularly Lickitung, which is easily 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after a Fake Tears, and Choice Band Hitmonchan, which is OHKOed after Fake Tears and a layer of Spikes. However, using Fake Tears requires a lot of prediction and is generally less safe to use than Substitute or Encore. Rain Dance can be used with Thunder as the STAB move, and this combination is great when used in tandem with Huntail as a sweeping partner. Apart from those two options, most other support moves are done better by Minun, which is slightly bulkier.</p>\n<p>In general, most specially bulky Pokemon can check Plusle, particularly Grass-types and other Pokemon that aren't weak to Thunderbolt like Swalot and Kecleon. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon make good teammates in order to blast through the Grass-types, and Flareon can easily countersweep Sunny Day Bellossom. Hitmonchan makes for a good teammate that can smash apart Kecleon and Lickitung. Piloswine and other Ground-types like Graveler are good teammates to take on the likes of Swalot, and they love Plusle's ability to remove Water- and Flying-types from the picture.</p>\n"

While it has little in the way of offensive coverage apart from its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ice and Grass, it doesn't really need the coverage to blast apart the opposition. It sits atop its throne as one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers available, a much-needed check to the Flying-types and sweepers like Huntail, and basically the cutest threat there is.</p>\n",

Not even Choice Band Kingler's Hidden Power Ground can 2HKO this set, and Hitmonchan only does 70% at most with its Choice Band-boosted Sky Uppercut. While it would be great if Relicanth could avoid a 2HKO from powerful STAB Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, literally every other physical attack barely even fazes this fish, giving your team a super solid backbone to rely on and pivot around. Rock + Ground is great attacking coverage and lets Relicanth fend off a huge portion of the Pokemon it'll be switching into, and having two attacking options means Relicanth is less of a liability while it's sleeping via Rest. That said, Toxic allows Relicanth to effectively wear down common defensive Pokemon like Sableye, and ultimately win stall wars via RestTalk, making it an option over the added coverage that Earthquake provides. Speaking of RestTalk, the combination allows Relicanth to absorb status for the remainder of its team, which is a somewhat rare commodity in NU, and greatly increases its own longevity throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is recommended to make Relicanth as physically bulky as possible; however, the EV spread is flexible depending on what you need Relicanth to do for your team. 84 Speed EVs can be run to allow Relicanth to outspeed uninvested Chimecho, but beware that Chimecho typically runs enough Speed to outrun Dewgong, so this may ultimately be a fruitless effort. 108 Attack EVs can be run to always OHKO standard Charmeleon with Rock Slide, although this is the only significant KO picked up by running any Attack less than maximum; otherwise, you're better off just using a more offensively oriented set. Swift Swim should be the ability because there aren't any recoil moves on this set, and the possibility to countersweep rain sweepers should always be kept open.</p>\n<p>Body Slam can be run on this set over Toxic or Earthquake to spread around paralysis. Yawn is another option in this moveslot to force the opponent to switch more often and accumulate Spikes damage or to just put the opposing Pokemon to sleep if it stays in, which can be game-changing. While unorthodox and typically not recommended, Calm Mind and Surf can be run on this set to turn Relicanth into an extremely bulky tank that's nearly impenetrable on both defenses. However, Surf is super weak until it's boosted to about +4, and Relicanth will rarely find the time to boost that high, since most special attackers will still blow through it with Grass- or Electric-type moves even if it's boosted. Psych Up can also be run on this set to protect Relicanth from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Chimecho and Swords Dance Kingler, although it will be a dead moveslot in most games.</p>\n<p>Defensive Relicanth fits best on teams that have glaring weaknesses to the Normal- and Flying-types found in the tier, particularly those that have Bellossom, Hitmonchan, and Venomoth all on the same team. Pairing Relicanth with a specially defensive bulwark like Kecleon can create a nigh-impregnable defensive core, and filling the defensive gap between the two against strong Fighting- and Ground-types with something like Chimecho, Pelipper, or Tangela can be a good idea.</p>\n"

Surf and Hydro Pump are the best choices for the last slot due to the boost they receive from the rain and STAB, even though they use Relicanth's lower Special Attack.</p>\n<p>There's a lot you can do with the EV spread, but the listed one is recommended and does several things. 52 Speed EVs let Relicanth outspeed minimum Speed Whiscash outside of rain and base Speed 95s and below in rain. 152 Special Attack EVs are enough to OHKO maximum HP Sudowoodo in the rain with Surf after Spikes damage. A bit more Speed can be run to outpace Raticate in the rain, but it's largely unneeded, since Raticate can't do a whole lot to Relicanth (though it may be worth it if you're scared of Reversal sets). Less Special Attack can be run if using Hydro Pump to put those EVs in HP to increase bulk. Surf and the Special Attack EVs can be dropped for something like Double-Edge, Hidden Power Bug, or Substitute. If doing this, move the Special Attack EVs to HP to increase overall bulk, as Relicanth does not need the extra Speed.</p>\n<p>This set makes a good one-two punch sweeping partner with Huntail, as Huntail can blast open holes in the opponent's defense for Relicanth to come in later to finish the job. Huntail also hits specially and Relicanth physically, making the duo hard to wall. Plusle and Pikachu are also really good offensive teammates, as they can set up Rain Dance and take advantage of the rain with an accurate Thunder, and Pikachu also receives a boosted Surf to play around with.</p>\n<p>This Relicanth has a really tough time with Grass-types, particularly defensive Tangela and Bellossom, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like specially attacking Flareon good teammates. Specially defensive teammates in general are good to have to absorb the Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks aimed Relicanth, making Kecleon and Lickitung good teammates. Relicanth can only KO Hitmonchan if it's been severely weakened, and Relicanth's lower bulk also means that it's more susceptible to Mach Punch than usual, meaning Swalot and Chimecho are good teammates too.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Say hello to the overall best Rock-type in NU. Relicanth has a lot of things going for it: it has the highest physical bulk in the tier (beating out even Shuckle), it's decently strong, it has great abilities, and its secondary Water typing is decently useful despite it adding weaknesses to Grass and Electric. Thanks to these factors, Relicanth can take on an offensive or defensive role for your team, making it easy to fit on teams looking for a good Normal and Flying check. However, its really common weaknesses, particularly its weakness to Fighting, are awful, and while it's a physically defensive behemoth, its Special Defense is pretty lacking. That said, you really can't go wrong with including Relicanth on your team; just keep an eye out for errant Grass-type attacks.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Relicanth's movepool is surprisingly large for a fish Pokemon, but the most effective sets have been listed above. Of the sets not listed, a Substitute + 3 attacks set is probably the most effective, with Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Double-Edge having sufficient coverage and Rock Head preventing recoil giving Relicanth a nice niche over similar users of the set like Pidgeot. A status platform set focusing on the various status moves Relicanth has like Toxic, Body Slam, and Yawn can be a fun gimmick to disrupt the opponent's team with, but going that route sacrifices Relicanth's overall effectiveness and longevity. Relicanth's immense physical bulk means a Swagger + Psych Up set is possible, although Relicanth is a bit too specially frail to really make use of it, as Relicanth's main revenge killers hit it specially, meaning it won't be able to risk staying in to get the Psych Up boost.</p>\n<p>Hidden Power Flying wasn't specifically mentioned before, but it gives Relicanth a move for both Grass-types and Hitmonchan in one moveslot. Relicanth is probably the best user of Rock Tomb in the tier and it gets STAB on the move, although Rock Slide's extra power is usually going to be more appreciated. Hydro Pump can make a decent last move to give Relicanth the jump on Mawile and Metang among other physically bulky Pokemon, but the needed Special Attack EVs to make it worth it are too costly in the long run. Finally, Blizzard is Relicanth's best option for Tangela and will completely throttle it, but its accuracy and the fact that defensive Tangela isn't super common mean it'll be a dead moveslot way more often than not.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Defensive Grass-types are the absolute best answers to any Relicanth set, with Tangela and Bellossom only really fearing Toxic and easily OHKOing back with their STAB moves. Roselia is even immune to Toxic, but it takes quite a bit more from Rock Slide. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and will leave a large dent in Relicanth with Sky Uppercut. If Relicanth lacks Toxic, it becomes huge setup bait for Bulk Up Hitmonchan. Plusle and Haunter have a hard time switching in but will easily 2HKO Relicanth with Thunderbolt. Mawile's Intimidate, immunity to Toxic, and Rock resistance make it a great switch-in as well, although it'll still take a decent amount from Earthquake; however, against Earthquake-less sets Mawile will easily get up a Substitute and start boosting with Swords Dance.</p>\n<p>In general, Hidden Power Grass destroys Relicanth, and a lot of Pokemon can easily find the room to stick it on their sets with the sole intention of nailing Relicanth with it. Murkrow in particular is notorious for having this option waiting in the wings, but many other Pokemon can find the room for it too, including Chimecho, Golbat, Lickitung, and Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This set is great at forcing switches, scouting the opponent's team out,\nand keeping offensive momentum, and as such, is very deserving of a slot\non balanced and offensive teams. Thunderbolt is the obligatory STAB move\nof choice as it hits many Pokemon hard. The choice of Hidden Power is\nbased around which threats your team needs to cover. Hidden Power Grass\ndestroys Swampert, a driving force in the Advance metagame. Hidden Power\nIce, on the other hand, creates a pseudo-BoltBeam combo, ploughs through\nFlygon, and takes a decent chunk out of Celebi and Venusaur, which\nforces the former to use Recover and quickly wears down the latter.</p>\n<p>Baton Pass is what differentiates Jolteon from Raikou. While Raikou is\nstopped cold by special walls, such as Snorlax and Blissey, and is\nforced to switch out by them, Jolteon can simply create a Substitute on\na predicted switch and Baton Pass it to a powerful physical or mixed\nattacker, which keeps the team's momentum going. Jolteon functions at\nits best in the lead slot. The reasons for this are not only because it\ncan put pressure on the opponent, but because it will often be difficult\nto get Jolteon in mid-game without it sustaining heavy damage of some\nsort while switching in.</p>\n<p>The item choice depends on whether or not Jolteon needs durability.\nLeftovers is the primary option as it allows Jolteon to hang in there\njust a bit longer and possibly Baton Pass one more Substitute. Petaya\nBerry enables Jolteon to pass a boost to a specially attacking teammate\nwhen weakened; it can in itself also become a threatening late-game\nsweeper after Blissey and Snorlax have been removed thanks to its\nawesome Speed stat. The EVs are simple: maximum Special Attack and Speed\ninvestment make Jolteon a potent offensive threat. However, one can\nshift some EVs to HP and make Jolteon slightly slower by using 176 Speed\nEVs along with a Timid nature; this lets Jolteon outpace\npositive-natured base 120 Speed Pokemon, notably Dugtrio and Sceptile,\nbut will leave it slower than other Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and some\nboosted Gyarados.</p>\n<p>Powerful physical or mixed attackers, such as Tyranitar, Blaziken, and\nMedicham, are good teammates for Jolteon; their wallbreaking\ncapabilities and sheer power make them ideal recipients for Substitute.\nAnother useful partner for Jolteon is Skarmory, who can set up the\nSpikes that Jolteon can take advantage of by forcing switches. The pair\nalso defend each other excellently: Skarmory is immune to the\nGround-type attacks that Jolteon loathes, and also baits the\nElectric-type attacks from which Jolteon can recover health. Dugtrio is\nalso an excellent recipient of Baton Passes from Jolteon as it rarely\nfinds a free switch-in, and Jolteon gives it an opportunity to. Dugtrio\ncan trap Celebi, and Blissey (if Adamant), thus opening up the opposing\nteam to Jolteon itself.</p>\n"
        }
      ], 
      "overview": "<p>One cannot help but compare Jolteon to Raikou, its fellow fast special\nattacking Electric-type. At face value, Raikou seems the superior\nchoice, as it has superior bulk and access to an excellent boosting move\nin Calm Mind. However, Jolteon has three main niches over Raikou. The\nfirst one is its superior base 130 Speed stat, which allows Jolteon to\neither plough through any Dugtrio moronic enough to switch in on Hidden\nPower, or evade its trapping by Baton Passing out of it. The second is\nits ability to Baton Pass Substitutes to powerful attackers such as\nBlaziken and Tyranitar, or just &quot;dry pass&quot; to an appropriate counter on\na predicted switch. The third niche is its excellent ability, Volt\nAbsorb, which allows it to switch in on Electric-type attacks with\nimpunity and recover off them, which slightly increases its longevity\nthroughout the game.</p>\n<p>A major difference between the pair is that while Raikou is a\ncomparatively poor lead--Blissey can switch in freely and give the\nopponent an advantage--Jolteon is an excellent lead that can keep your\nteam's offensive momentum going by Baton Passing Substitutes. Jolteon is\nnot bereft of flaws though, as it is vulnerable to all forms of status,\nSpikes, and sandstorm's residual damage; it is also very frail. These\nnegative attributes mean that Jolteon is worn down quickly in slow-paced\ngames.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>While Jolteon does not have the bulk to phaze reliably, it can make some\nuse of Roar thanks to its ability to force switches as an offensive\npivot. With Spikes support, Roar Jolteon can wear down the likes of\nSnorlax on predicted switches and weaken it to the point where Jolteon\ncan take it out and sweep. Roar Jolteon can also act as an effective\ncheck to Calm Mind Raikou, as most Raikou users will stay in and boost.\nJolteon has access to Wish, but Vaporeon and Umbreon are more suited to\nthis job thanks to their higher bulk and lower Speed. Jolteon can also\nBaton Pass Speed boosts with Agility, which can support a powerful but\nslow sweeper such as Swords Dance Marowak. However, to pass on Agility\nboosts, Jolteon will either have to forgo Substitute or Hidden Power.</p>\n<p>Toxic can be used to hit Swampert on the switch, which frees up a\nmoveslot for Jolteon to use Hidden Power Ice to take down threats such\nas Flygon and Salamence. Jolteon has access to Thunder Wave, but this is\nfairly useless as nearly all of its counters are either immune to it\n(Flygon, Swampert, Camerupt, and Steelix), have the Natural Cure ability\n(Blissey and Celebi), or are slow and hence don't mind paralysis\n(Snorlax). Finally, Jolteon can use Tickle or Charm on the switch to\ntake the punch out of attacks from Snorlax, Flygon, and Swampert. All in\nall, however, Jolteon's movepool is not particularly large, and it is\nprobably best to stick to the listed set.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Jolteon is difficult to counter in the traditional sense as there are\nvery few ways to stop it from doing its job. Steelix gets a special\nmention for being one of the few Ground-types that is not weak to either\nHidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass, while Swampert works against\nJolteon that lack Hidden Power Grass; both can also use Roar to force\nJolteon out.</p>\n<p>However, Jolteon has a multitude of checks. It can't do much to special\nwalls such as Blissey, Regice, and Snorlax, but all three can do little\nto prevent Jolteon from Baton Passing Substitutes. Raikou can set up\nwith Calm Mind on any Jolteon lacking Roar, and can even use Roar itself\nto prevent SubPassing. Flygon easily walls Jolteon that carry Hidden\nPower Grass, but Flygon and Swampert should first scout out Jolteon's\nHidden Power of choice through smart switching; the latter can use\nProtect to do so as well. Defensive Grass-types, such as Celebi and\nVenusaur, do an excellent job at checking Jolteon as they resist\nThunderbolt and take little from a weak Hidden Power. Furthermore, both\nhave recovery, and as such prove a constant thorn in Jolteon's side.\nPorygon2 and Gardevoir are both excellent checks to Jolteon, as Trace\nlets them copy Volt Absorb and their high Special Defense stats enable\nthem to wall Jolteon to no end.</p>\n",

It has access to Focus Punch, which allows it to muscle\npast one of its prime counters--Skarmory--and an excellent boosting move\nin Swords Dance. However, unlike the likes of Salamence and Tyranitar,\nwhich have all they need and more in the movepool department, Heracross\nlacks an expansive pool of viable moves.</p>\n<p>A Bulk Up set is an interesting prospect for Heracross, with either 3\nattacks, or Rest and Sleep Talk alongside Megahorn. However, the former\nvariant is outclassed by its Swords Dancing counterpart, as many of its\ncounters OHKO it even at +1 Defense, making the defensive boost rather\nirrelevant, and Heracross is much more destructive with Swords Dance.\nThe latter set is severely walled by Salamence and Gyarados. Both Bulk\nUp sets are also incredibly handy Spikes fodder for Skarmory, so\nMagneton is an advised teammate for Bulk Up Heracross. Earthquake can\npotentially do that little bit of extra damage to finish off Metagross\nand Jirachi from a slightly higher range of health, and could be\npotentially fit in as a fourth option on the Choice Band set, but\notherwise, it is difficult to fit Earthquake onto Heracross. Toxic is\nalways an option, but in Heracross's case, it is rather pointless, as\nHeracross is much better off repeatedly bashing at its counters than\ntrying to wear them down with status, due to its immense attacking\npower.</p>\n<p>Counter is a potential option, although many of Heracross's best\ncounters OHKO it with Flying STAB, such as Skarmory, enemy Heracross,\nand Gyarados. Counter is difficult to use on Heracross, as it resists\nthree of the most common physical attacking types--Fighting, Ground, and\nBug--so few players will aim attacks of those types at Heracross.\nHeracross is often better off simply attacking users with Normal- and\nRock-type attacks, and Poison- and Ghost-type moves are extremely rare.\nHeracross could potentially Counter on a Weezing Sludge Bomb, or a\nDusclops Shadow Ball. Hidden Power Flying is a highly niche option that\ncan be used specifically to cover other Heracross. Similarly to\nEarthquake, it will most likely see use in the fourth slot on the Choice\nBand set.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Salamence and Gyarados resist both Bug and Fighting and have Intimidate\nto mitigate damage from Megahorn. Still, Heracross packs a huge punch,\nand Rock Slide hits both of them pretty hard. Skarmory takes about 30%\nfrom Brick Break and is not only 2HKOed by Focus Punch Heracross, but\nOHKOed by Guts and Choice Band variants. However, it does have an\nawesome base 140 Defense and 4x resistance to Megahorn, so most of the\ntime it should be fine. Weezing resists Megahorn, can Haze away any\nboosts, and eliminate Heracross with Fire Blast, Flamethrower, or Sludge\nBomb. It might run into trouble though, as it doesn't have a reliable\nway to recover, and if it uses Will-O-Wisp or poisons Heracross with\nSludge Bomb, Guts will activate to make Heracross even more powerful.\nAdditionally, Facade will 2HKO Weezing. Dugtrio can trap and take out\nHeracross with Aerial Ace; it's not going to take any hits and live,\nthough, and loses to Endure + Salac Berry variants.</p>\n<p>There's also Arcanine, who has Intimidate and resists Megahorn, but you\nseriously don't want to switch it in on any other attack. Moltres and\nCharizard resist Bug and Fighting as well, but are OHKOed by Rock Slide;\nsimilar considerations apply to Zapdos. Crobat 4x resists both\nHeracross's STABs and can OHKO with Flying moves, but must watch out for\nRock Slide as well.</p>\n",

Revenge is the chosen STAB move because Machoke will almost always be going second, and this set is meant to tank through the opponent's team, meaning it thrives on being hit first and dishing the damage back out. Cross Chop is still an option for an always-powerful move, though the accuracy hurts its viability a bit. Hidden Power Ghost is needed coverage for Haunter and Chimecho, though Machoke should never stay in versus Chimecho, as it's almost always OHKOed by Psychic. Earthquake is Machoke's best option to take out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Machoke's best move for Roselia and Sableye. Rock Slide helps take out the Bug- and Flying-types likely to switch into Machoke, although Revenge will normally be doing enough to the two main Flying-types, Pidgeot and Murkrow, as they're neutral to Fighting. Lastly, Encore is also a very viable option which can make setting up far easier and forces switches. Locking something like Mawile into a status move also gives Machoke the Guts boost it loves.</p>\n<p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. More or less Speed can be run depending on how you want to play Machoke, with 0 Speed being an option to ensure Machoke goes second against as many Pokemon as possible in order to power up Revenge. A physically or specially defensive spread can also be used by moving the Attack EVs to whichever defensive stat you want, since even with no Attack investment, at +1 and with a Guts boost Machoke is going to be hitting like a truck regardless. A specially defensive spread can help Machoke take out the likes of Dewgong and Glalie, while a physically defensive spread can allow Machoke to more easily switch into Rock-types like Pupitar.</p>\n<p>Focus Punch and Brick Break can be used as alternative STAB moves, but both are less useful than Revenge and Cross Chop in most cases. If using a Substitute + Bulk Up set, with Substitute used in the last slot over Rock Slide or Encore, Focus Punch becomes a far more desirable option to consider, as the additional power is incredible for breaking normally safe switch-ins like Chimecho. If using Machoke as a lure to open up a Hitmonchan sweep, Hidden Power Bug is also an option to destroy defensive Tangela, but overall Hidden Power Ghost is more important for Haunter and Chimecho.</p>\n<p>Special walls are needed teammates to bring when using Machoke to switch in on the inevitable opposing Chimecho and Haunter, making Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung good teammates.

Hidden Power Ghost is needed for Haunter and Chimecho and generally pairs well with Machoke's Fighting-type STAB move. Rock Slide lets Machoke take out certain Flying- and Bug-types looking to switch into Machoke's Fighting STAB move, particularly Pelipper and Venomoth. The move in the last slot will be rarely used, but Earthquake is still needed for Swalot and Arbok, and it is Machoke's hardest hit against Sableye.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference when using Choice Band Machoke over Choice Band Hitmonchan is you want to try to switch Machoke into predicted status moves to activate Guts. While Hitmonchan would be utterly crippled and walled by Toxic Sableye, Machoke can actually use it to its advantage and cleanly 2HKO even 252 / 252+ Sableye with Earthquake if it's hit by Toxic. This makes Machoke theoretically a better choice to combat heavy stall teams, but in practice Machoke will still be worn down pretty quickly and is more easy to outspeed than Hitmonchan, meaning even the slower stall teams won't find it too difficult to revenge kill Machoke.</p>\n<p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. From there, Attack is maxed out and the remaining EVs are placed into HP to increase Machoke's bulk as much as possible. Focus Punch can be used over any of the moves on this set, and after a Guts boost it becomes the single strongest attack in the tier without any needed setup. It can be pretty tricky to use, but it has a ton of payoff if it connects over Cross Chop, notably OHKOing Huntail, 2HKOing Chimecho, and OHKOing defensive Tangela after a Guts boost. Revenge is another alternative reliable STAB option, but it doesn't garner any notable KOs over Brick Break, and Machoke typically wants to outspeed what it can with this set. Finally, Facade can be used somewhere on this set to take advantage of the status that Machoke will likely absorb for your team, and it'll hit nearly as hard as Cross Chop without the risk of missing.</p>\n<p>Teammates are needed to take on Chimecho and Haunter, making special walls like Kecleon and Dark-types like Murkrow good teammates.

Machoke also has a great ability in Guts, which allows it to hit astronomically harder than Hitmonchan if you play your cards right.

For alternative move options, Machoke is bulky enough to make use of Counter pretty effectively, but most attacks coming its way are likely going to be special. Body Slam and Rock Tomb give Machoke a way to slow down the opposition and can make switching into it a bit harder for the opponent. Light Screen can be used pretty effectively to protect Machoke from Chimecho and Haunter switch-ins and give it the chance to take them out, but there are typically better options for doing so and Machoke still isn't really specially bulky enough to fully take advantage of it. Finally, Low Kick is another alternative STAB option, but the NU metagame is pretty light, meaning it'll likely be outdamaged by Machoke's other STAB options most of the time.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Chimecho is the top counter to any Machoke set, as it can easily switch in, outspeed, and OHKO even max HP Machoke with Psychic. Haunter can also switch into most of Machoke's attacks, although it has a bigger fear of Hidden Power Ghost than Chimecho, and easily OHKO with Psychic. Sableye has to be wary of giving Machoke a Guts boost, but without one it completely walls Machoke unless Machoke gathers too many Bulk Up boosts. Defensive Tangela isn't 2HKOed by anything Machoke can throw at it except a Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch, and it can easily Leech Seed stall out Machoke. Arbok and Swalot can wall Machoke pretty effectively if it lacks Earthquake and proceed to take it out with a couple of Sludge Bombs, but they need to be careful of giving Machoke a Guts boost. Pelipper resists Machoke's Fighting STAB moves and can proceed to stall Machoke out or easily 2HKO it with Hydro Pump if using an offensive set, although it doesn't like Rock Slide. Most Bug-types, particularly Venomoth, are also good switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide. Finally, most special attackers are generally good answers to Machoke, as its Special Defense pales in comparison to its Defense.</p>\n",

The last slot goes to a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass shreds Relicanth, Whiscash, Graveler, and other Rock-types like Sudowoodo.

Relicanth, Kecleon, and Torkoal are good examples of Pokemon that can allow this, particularly the former, as it is a hard stop to Pidgeot and Murkrow as well other Choice Band users like Kingler and Raticate. Kecleon is also valuable to almost hard counter Chimecho and Haunter, as they'll likely switch in to OHKO Seviper with Psychic.</p>\n<p>An offensive teammate to make use of Seviper's ability to wallbreak is a definite must when considering using this set.

Other good offensive teammates include those that require turns of setup to become threatening, such as Vigoroth, Pupitar, and Kingler.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Seviper's Attack stat is equal to its Special Attack, and it even gets a strong STAB move to make use of it, making a Choice Band set a great choice. The only downside is that overall a Choice Band set is done slightly better by Arbok, which sports higher Speed and better bulk backed up by Intimidate. Still, Seviper packs more power, and because Seviper has the element of surprise with its massive special movepool, it's still a highly recommended set when considering Seviper for your team.</p>\n<p>Sludge Bomb and Earthquake have really good coverage together, with the latter providing super effective hits on enemy Poison-, Steel-, and Rock-types that resist or are immune to Sludge Bomb. Hidden Power Ghost is for Haunter and gets a slightly stronger hit on Chimecho than Sludge Bomb does. Unfortunately, Seviper doesn't get Rock Slide, another perk Arbok sports over its slithery friend, but the last slot here is largely filler anyway. Iron Tail is a good safety move, minus the accuracy, that ensures a super effective hit on Rock-types when using Earthquake could lead to a free switch to a Flying-type or a Levitate user by the opponent. Double-Edge is stronger and more reliable overall than Iron Tail, but this comes at the cost of any super effective coverage.</p>\n<p>An Adamant nature and maximum Speed are run to give Seviper as much power as possible while retaining the ability to Speed tie with neutral-natured max Speed Flareon and Chimecho. Jolly is definitely an option, as outspeeding neutral Flareon and Chimecho with this set is heavenly, but the drop in power isn't worth it in the long run. A Naughty nature can be used with a special move, particularly Giga Drain, in the last slot, which gives Seviper a much better tool to use against Whiscash and other physically bulkier Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb like Relicanth and Graveler.</p>\n<p>This set has a hard time with Rock- and Steel-types, even with Earthquake available, making a physical sweeping partner such as Hitmonchan or a special attacker like Seadra or Haunter valued teammates. Defensive Chimecho can be lured in and eliminated, or at the very least sufficiently weakened, with Hidden Power Ghost, further making Hitmonchan and other Pokemon walled by it, like Plusle, good teammates to bring when using Seviper. A switch-in to Flying-types and Haunter is needed for this set to be successful, as they will gladly switch into a Choice-locked Earthquake at the first chance they get, meaning physically defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and specially defensive Pokemon like Kecleon should be paired with Seviper as well. In the same vein, having a good answer to Mawile is crucial to this set's success, as it will use its immunity to Sludge Bomb to set up Substitute or Swords Dance without hesitation, making Flareon a good teammate as well.</p>\n"

Poison is also a nice typing to switch into opposing Pokemon, and an offensive Pokemon that can switch into Choice Band Hitmonchan's STAB attacks is always a plus. Beyond that, though, it doesn't have much going for it. Shed Skin is neat to absorb status from defensive teams, but Seviper is super frail and a bit on the slow side. It languishes at the bottom of the pack for mixed attackers, as it ultimately doesn't offer that much over similar options in Crawdaunt, Cacturne, and Octillery and finds itself wanting either more bulk or more Speed in most battles.</p>\n",

Going mixed will always keep your opponent guessing as to what moves Seviper is or isn't using and can definitely lead to some misplays by them. Substitute can be used when going mixed to further ease prediction on Seviper's part, as well as raise the anxiety of your opponent to keep them guessing as to what Seviper is running.</p>\n<p>Most of Seviper's viable moves were listed above, but there are a couple left worth mentioning. Glare is probably done better by Arbok, but it does give Seviper a tool to use against faster Pokemon thinking they can switch into a predicted attacking move. Taunt allows Seviper to mess with defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Flareon and prevent them from healing, but overall Seviper is a bit too frail to make very good use of it. Finally, Seviper is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Haze, which could be valuable in preventing a dangerous setup sweeper from sweeping your team.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>In general, Chimecho can tank an attack from Seviper and easily OHKO it back with STAB Psychic; it just needs to be careful of Crunch and Hidden Power Ghost, both of which will leave a huge dent in it. Haunter and Venomoth with Psychic can easily outspeed and OHKO Seviper as well, though the latter needs a layer of Spikes to ensure the KO. Ground-types that can tank a Flamethrower or Giga Drain will easily OHKO Seviper with Earthquake, which admittedly is mostly just Piloswine. Other Pokemon that outspeed with Earthquake will have an easy time with Seviper too, particularly Hitmonchan, Glalie, and Vigoroth. Fire-types have the easiest time with the special attacker set if it lacks Hidden Power Water, but they have a very hard time with the physical sets. Finally, Mawile and Metang need to avoid the special attacker and mixed sets, but they have a very easy time against the Choice Band set as long as they avoid Earthquake.</p>\n",

Physical walls\nthat aren't affected by Ground-type attacks, such as Skarmory and\nWeezing, easily wall Dugtrio, because they can't be trapped by Arena\nTrap, are immune to Earthquake, and take little damage from Dugtrio's\nother attacks.

If you're using a -Special Attack nature (Adamant, for example), you need 68 EVs to reach that. However, without that, Nidoking already has 206 Special Attack, so there's no need to stack it any more. Generally you'll want to focus on Attack to put a little strength behind his Earthquakes, while his Special moves should be designed to kill specific threats like Gligar.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Your options are limited. Quagsire, Whiscash, Politoed, Poliwrath,\nWalrein, and Blastoise work as counters in the same way as the Waters\nfrom standard: they do not like Choice Band Earthquakes, and Quagsire\nand Whiscash do not like Hidden Power Grass, but they take the hits from\nany of his other moves rather well.

Double Kick is a novelty move, but is notable for allowing\nNidoking to entirely destroy Tyraniboah. Not only does Double Kick let\nNidoking both break Tyranitar's Substitute and damage it, Nidoking also\nresists Focus Punch and is immune to Thunderbolt. Thunder does more\ndamage to Water-types than Thunderbolt does, and has a higher paralysis\nchance to boot, but Thunderbolt's greater accuracy is preferred.\nNidoking can use Roar to phaze away Scizor and Ninjask, as well as\nZapdos and Jolteon that lack Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Grass is an\ninteresting option to hit Swampert.</p>\n<p>Toxic and Thief can help wear down opponents, but once again, Nidoking\nis better off smashing in its opponents' faces instead of stalling them\nout. Rest + Sleep Talk is, as always, a nice combination on Pokemon that\ncan take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb sleep from Grass-types and\nsurprise them with Sludge Bomb, but the loss of two moveslots does hurt\nhis great versatility. Protect can be used to scout for Earthquake and\nExplosion, to reduce prediction against Choice Band users, and to gain\nsome Leftovers recovery. Substitute can be used in combination with a\npowerful special move such as Fire Blast or Thunder to help Nidoking\ndispose of Weezing.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Suicune and Milotic can switch in on anything except Choice Band\nEarthquake as they shrug off even Thunderbolt, and then dispose of\nNidoking with Surf. Swampert is further immune to Thunderbolt and packs\nSTAB Earthquake, but it must watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Weezing\nmakes an all-around good counter as it resists Sludge Bomb and Megahorn,\nis immune to Earthquake, and takes little damage from Rock Slide thanks\nto its high Defense. Aside from using Will-O-Wisp on Nidoking and\nwearing it down with Sludge Bomb, Weezing can also use Pain Split to\nrestore HP. However, watch out for Substitute, which will block\nWill-O-Wisp, as well as special attack such as Fire Blast and Thunder.\nSkarmory can wall Nidoking and set up Spikes on it if Nidoking lacks a\nFire or Electric move. Much the same goes for Forretress; while it lacks\nan Earthquake immunity, it is not weak to Electric, and its own\nEarthquake 2HKOes Nidoking.</p>\n<p>Flygon's typing and ability allow it to switch in on all of Earthquake,\nRock Slide, Sludge Bomb, and Thunderbolt; it can then OHKO Nidoking with\nSTAB Earthquake. However, it takes huge damage from Ice Beam and Choice\nBand Megahorn. Claydol can better sponge Ice Beam, but is slower and\ntakes even more damage from Megahorn. Donphan's high Defense makes it an\nideal counter to physical sets; however, Ice Beam will take out about\nhalf its health. Celebi can destroy Nidoking with Psychic, but it is\nOHKOed by Choice Band Megahorn and 2HKOed by non-Choice Band Megahorn\nand Sludge Bomb, so make sure to switch it in safely.</p>\n",

As a Fire-type special wall, Flareon has an important role in the metagame as a check and counter to a multitude of threats, including Chlorophyll sweepers, Plusle, and Haunter. Wish + Protect provides reliable recovery, with Protect also allowing Flareon to scout the foe's movesets and bide time for more Leftovers recovery. Flamethrower is recommended as a reliable STAB move, and thanks to Flareon's decent Special Attack stat it hits much of the tier decently hard. Fire Blast can be used instead if you desire more power, but the accuracy can be troublesome when you're depending on Flareon to check certain attackers. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the second slot over Protect to gain coverage on Water- and Rock-types and prevents Huntail and Pupitar from using Flareon as complete setup bait. The last slot is recommended to go to Baton Pass, as it is a major tool Flareon has over many of the other defensive Pokemon in NU, and it allows Flareon to pivot in and out of threats and more carefully pass Wishes to its teammates. This said, Toxic is a good alternative in the last slot, as it is Flareon's best weapon for opposing Flareon and other defensive switch-ins such as Wailord and Pelipper.</p>\n<p>A fully specially defensive EV spread best makes use of Flareon's stats and typing, effectively allowing Flareon to check and counter threats like Chlorophyll sweepers throughout the match. There is one key alternate move to consider over the choices provided: Roar. Roar is rarely seen in the NU metagame and is worth strongly considering when using Flareon on heavy stall teams as a way to rack up Spikes damage and prevent bulky setup sweepers like Chimecho from dominating the team. However, Flareon has a tough time using Roar to check many of the prominent setup sweepers in the tier, since many of them beat it one-on-one such as Huntail, Vigoroth, Hitmonchan, and Pupitar.</p>\n<p>The amazing thing about this set is that it fits on every team archetype thanks to Baton Pass allowing it to keep up momentum on more offensive teams and its utility and access to Wish giving it a secure place on defensive teams. Flareon is the center of many common defensive cores thanks to the great type synergy it has with many of the physical walls in NU. Sableye and Chimecho are great teammates to pair with Flareon, and together they form one of the sturdiest stall cores in the metagame. Other physical walls that do not have a Ground- or Rock-type weakness make great teammates for Flareon, such as Tangela, Lickitung, and Whiscash. As the cornerstone of this set is Wish, having Pokemon on the team that benefit from its support is a good idea. Setup sweepers that do not have recovery like Huntail, Pupitar, and Kingler are all Pokemon that appreciate Flareon as a teammate.</p>\n"

With this fact in mind, Choice Band Flareon finds its place on teams in need of a wallbreaker, and with Flareon's most common set being defensive, this set can easily get surprise KOs that other more popular wallbreakers would miss out on. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Ground provide great neutral coverage alongside Double-Edge, which is good considering Flareon's physical movepool stops right about there. Overheat can fill the third moveslot to get a stronger hit on a few of the would-be Hidden Power Ground targets, namely Mawile and Metang, even with a Special Attack-lowering nature. However, getting locked into an ineffective Overheat can be game ending. The last slot is dedicated to Baton Pass to allow Flareon to &quot;dry pass&quot; to maintain momentum for its team and scout the opponent's switches.</p>\n<p>An Adamant nature is recommended to allow Flareon to hit as hard as possible, but a Jolly nature is also usable to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonchan. Return or Body Slam can be run over Double-Edge if the recoil sounds unappealing, but the loss in power is noticeable against certain bulky targets like physically defensive Wailord, where both Return and Body Slam miss out on the 2HKO. Other Hidden Power types can be used over Ground. Hidden Power Rock is usable as a way to maintain a super effective hit on Fire-types while gaining a super effective hit on Flying-types such as Pidgeot and Pelipper; however, this would be at the cost of missing out on super effective hits against Rock- and Steel-types such as Mawile and Relicanth. Hidden Power Fighting allows Flareon to maintain the super effective hit on Rock- and Steel-types and gain a super effective hit on Normal-types like Lickitung but loses the super effective hit on Fire- and Poison-types. Finally, Quick Attack is a good safety net option to allow Flareon to pick off weakened sweepers such as Raticate and Plusle, but without STAB it can be pretty weak and dangerous to be locked into.</p>\n<p>This set thrives on Spikes support, as most of the Pokemon that are able to comfortably switch into a Double-Edge are damaged by Spikes, making Glalie and Roselia recommended teammates. As Flareon's main role on a team is as a wallbreaker, Flareon should be paired with sweepers that can make use of holes Flareon can punch into the opposing team. This set is particularly effective at luring in and weakening bulky Water-types, such as Wailord and Whiscash, making late-game sweepers like Huntail and Pupitar good teammates. Each of Flareon's moves on this set have immunities, meaning playing with Choice Band Flareon requires expert use of Baton Pass to scout the opponent's team to check for Pokemon that could potentially switch into Flareon for free. With this in mind, Flareon needs good defensive teammates to switch out to should the opponent be able to predict well and switch a Pokemon into a move they have an immunity to. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Mawile are all good defensive Pokemon that can switch into a wide range of the Pokemon that could make use of the aforementioned immunities, such as popular Flying-types like Murkrow making use of Hidden Power Ground, Ghost-types like Haunter making use of Double-Edge, and Normal-types like Raticate making use of Shadow Ball.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set is designed to make the most of Flareon's decent base 95 Special Attack stat and break holes in the opponent's special walls that are typically safe switch-ins to it. At maximum Special Attack investment, Flareon can threaten a 3HKO against specially defensive Wailord with Hidden Power Grass and deal upwards of 75% to Choice Band Hitmonchan with Fire Blast, easily opening holes for a teammate like Huntail to come in later and clean up. Fire Blast or Overheat is needed to hit as hard as possible, with Fire Blast being a consistently powerful option and Overheat being the better option if you are confident in your ability to get Flareon in and out of battle safely. With Charcoal and the EV spread given, Overheat will easily OHKO Choice Band Hitmonchan after Spikes and deal over 50% to specially defensive Kecleon, Swalot, and Chimecho. Hidden Power Water is a good alternative to Hidden Power Grass as a tool to break opposing Flareon and other Fire-types. Depending on which Hidden Power you choose, Toxic is going to be Flareon's best weapon for either Water- or Fire-types. The last slot comes down to how you want Flareon to function on your team. Baton Pass allows Flareon to keep momentum and scout the opponent's switches, whereas Protect can stall for Toxic damage and scout Choice Band users' attacks.</p>\n<p>A Modest nature is used to hit as hard as possible, but a Timid nature is usable in order to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonchan. Sunny Day is definitely usable on this set to power up Flareon's Fire-type STAB attack, weaken the foe's Water-type attacks aimed at Flareon, and support a Chlorophyll teammate; however, Baton Pass and Protect allow Flareon to fit on a wider variety of teams. Hidden Power Electric can be used to maintain a super effective hit on Water-types and gain a super effective hit on Flying-types at the cost of losing a super effective hit on Rock-types.</p>\n<p>This set should be paired with another specially offensive teammate to make use of the holes that Flareon is going to punch into the opposing team. Huntail and Seadra, in particular, enjoy the opponent's Water-types weakened enough for them to blast through with their own Hidden Power Grass. Sunny Day Bellossom enjoys this Flareon as a partner in order to weaken various special walls like Kecleon, Lickitung, and Chimecho, as well as providing a decent defensive backbone to switch out to against typical counters like Roselia, opposing Flareon, and Swalot.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Flareon is easily the best Fire-type in NU thanks to its great special bulk, good offensive presence, and access to two key moves in Wish and Baton Pass. It is mostly seen in the tier as a specially defensive wall that not only is hard to pin down because of Baton Pass but also keeps itself and its teammates healthy thanks to Wish. As if trying to break through its fiery hide was not tough enough, its offensive presence really cannot be understated, since even without STAB moves its massive base 130 Attack stat makes its physical attacks hit like a train, and its base 95 Special Attack is still well above average by NU standards. The only things keeping Flareon from dominating the tier are its low Speed and Defense, its shallow movepool, and the fact that it loses to the two best Pokemon in the tier one-on-one: Hitmonchan and Huntail. If you keep its downsides in mind, Flareon is more than worthy of a teamslot on any team.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>An Endure + Flail + Salac Berry set can make the most of Flareon's massive Attack stat and decent Speed, but this is ultimately outclassed by Kingler due to its higher Speed. Iron Tail is an option for physically attacking sets to get a hard hit on Rock-types if not using Hidden Power Ground, but the accuracy is highly undesirable. Finally, a Curse + Baton Pass set is attractive at first glance but requires ace-like prediction, and there are far better options for short-passing in the tier. However, this sort of set can see use on full Baton Pass chains, and Flareon is a dangerous presence on these chains should Special Attack boosts come its way.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Flareon is pretty hard to outright counter due to Baton Pass, its ability to use special and physical attacks with gusto, and the fact that most of its would-be counters absolutely despise getting hit by Toxic. That said, bulky Water-types such as Wailord and Dewgong are going to be your safest switch-ins on first appearance, as they resist Fire Blast, will be able to tank an attack from the Choice Band set, and can threaten back with Surf. After Water-types, Fire-types are going to be the next best switch-ins to any Flareon set, with a Flareon of your own being able to potentially make use of Flash Fire. Magcargo and Torkoal are also very capable switch-ins to Flareon and can easily force it out should it lack Hidden Power Water or Hidden Power Ground. Relicanth is practically immune to Flareon's physical attacks and Fire-type STAB moves but needs to be super wary of Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Kecleon and Lickitung can easily counter special attacking variants of Flareon but need to be careful of straying into the path of a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge. Apart from defensive counters, Flareon is actually pretty easy to revenge kill. Fast physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Murkrow, Kingler, and Pupitar can easily O-2HKO Flareon. Huntail and Seadra easily 2HKO even maximum Special Defense Flareon, and Huntail OHKOes Flareon with Hydro Pump in the rain. Finally, Diglett gets special mention for being able to trap Flareon and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>\n",

Pursuit does exactly that, catching spinblockers\nswitching out for double damage. Fire Blast is generally the better\nchoice for the next slot, as Flamethrower can fail to OHKO the likes of\nMetagross with some HP investment. Crunch is the primary choice for the\nthird slot, as the threat of Pursuit often dissuades Gengar from\nswitching out and it can land an OHKO on any brazen enough to stay in.\nCrunch can also actively threaten the rarer Dusclops, which can weaken\nHoundoom if it only has Pursuit. Hidden Power Grass can also fill the\nthird slot to take a huge chunk out of Swampert and dent other\nWater-types. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can take out Salamence and\nFlygon, as Houndoom outspeeds their standard sets. The fourth slot can\nbe filled by one of two status moves, namely Will-O-Wisp or Toxic.\nWill-O-Wisp is better against physical attackers such as Gyarados,\nFlygon, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, Utilitylax, and Salamence, while Toxic\ncripples non-Rest Swampert and Milotic, and is also better in\nlast-Pokemon situations.</p>\n<p>The EVs given hit 300 Speed, beating all standard Salamence and Flygon.\nIf using Hidden Power Ice, you should drop Houndoom's Attack and Defense\nIVs to 30 as opposed to dropping its Speed IV. 56 HP gives a total\ndivisible by 16 for optimal Leftovers gain. Maximum Special Attack is\nused rather than significant defensive investment because Houndoom is\npainfully frail and unlikely to stay around for a prolonged period of\ntime.</p>\n<p>Houndoom is a useful partner for the Spikes-laying spinners Forretress\nand Cloyster, as the pair have difficulty successfully executing a spin\nagainst more defensive Gengar and Dusclops in Cloyster's case and any\nGhost-type whatsoever in Forretress's. With spinblockers out of the way,\nboth Forretress and Cloyster will be able to more effectively keep\nSpikes off your side of the field. Houndoom also synergizes very well\nwith Gengar, being immune to Psychic-type moves and resisting Ghost- and\nDark-type moves, whilst Gengar is immune to Fighting- and Ground-type\nmoves and can help Houndoom's Spikes-using partners keep their entry\nhazards up. Roar also works very well in conjunction with this\ncombination of Pokemon to take advantage of Spikes to their fullest.\nHowever, this can be a dangerous strategy if the opponent has Dugtrio.\nHoundoom also enjoys support from Pokemon that are able to switch into\nbulky Water-types, such as RestTalk Zapdos and Celebi. Zapdos is useful\nin that it can absorb Gengar's Hypnosis, which can put Houndoom out of\ncommission for a while, and also does not share a weakness to Dugtrio.\nHowever, Celebi also checks Snorlax and Blissey with the combination of\nLeech Seed and Calm Mind.</p>\n"

However, Houndoom is capable of filling an often pivotal role:\nPursuit-trapping the spinblocker Gengar while also providing a\nconsistent switch-in to Celebi and Superachi with its immunity to\nPsychic, resistance to Grass, and powerful Fire Blast. Its ability to\nremove Gengar is especially significant, as it allows for the likes of\nForretress and Cloyster to successfully Rapid Spin with greater ease.\nPursuit also helps open up a sweep from the likes of Earthquake Curselax\nand allows Explosion to be used with less fear.</p>\n",

However, in doing this you often sacrifice coverage or status,\nand if your team is physically strong enough for Beat Up, then it\nshouldn't have problems with the special sponges. If you do use it,\nthough, be sure to use nicknames so as not to prematurely reveal your\nteam! Houndoom can exchange Early Bird for Flash Fire in order to get a\nboost off a predicted Fire attack, but it loses the ability to wake up\nmore quickly from the likes of Gengar's Hypnosis and also gains a\ncounter in Porygon2. Houndoom can potentially use a SunnyBeam set to\nclean up late-game, but it is generally far too slow to sweep, and this\ndefies its main purpose as a Pursuit trapper. Sleep Talk without Rest is\ndecent, due to the popularity of Hypnosis Gengar against Pursuit users,\nespecially if you have no sleep absorber; however, it can be somewhat of\na waste of a moveslot in a lot of cases.</p>\n<p>Houndoom can use Counter alongside Will-O-Wisp, the idea behind the set\nbeing to catch Tyranitar or Snorlax on the switch-in with Will-O-Wisp\nand then survive an unboosted burnt Rock Slide or Earthquake to Counter\nit back for the KO. It can also do the same against burnt Aerodactyl's\nRock Slide with 52 HP and 48 Defense EVs. However, in most cases you are\nbetter off switching to a defensive Pokemon such as Swampert or\nSkarmory, who can easily take these attacks and do damage or set up\nSpikes in return, because Tyranitar and Aerodactyl nearly always have no\nrecovery or way to remove status and Snorlax sometimes will not Rest\neither.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Being a specially oriented, frail Fire-type, Houndoom is countered by a\nvast array of Pokemon. The special walls Snorlax and Blissey easily\ndefeat it, sponging Fire Blasts merrily while either statusing Houndoom\nor just bashing away at it. Non-Rest Snorlax needs to watch out for\nWill-O-Wisp though, as this can cripple it and remove its offensive\npresence. Milotic and Suicune can switch into Houndoom repeatedly and\nthreaten it with STAB super effective Surfs. Milotic is especially\nnotable as it loves to absorb Will-O-Wisp thanks to its Marvel Scale\nability. It also has instant recovery, unlike Suicune, which is forced\nto use Rest. However, Milotic must watch out for Toxic, as this will\ngreatly decrease its longevity.</p>\n<p>Dugtrio can trap and OHKO with Earthquake if brought in on a predicted\nswitch or when Houndoom has just made a kill. However, one must remember\nthat it cannot switch in on an awake Houndoom without the heavy risk of\nan OHKO from Fire Blast. Tyranitar, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Flygon, and\nGyarados are all in the same boat when it comes to Houndoom: they are\nall fairly decent answers to it, resisting Fire moves and KOing back,\nbut being physical attackers without a way to remove status, none of\nthem can deal well with a Will-O-Wisp burn. RestTalk Zapdos can deal\nwith Houndoom outside of sand or if it has Flamethrower instead of Fire\nBlast.</p>\n",

Explosion gains momentum for the team, allowing a Chlorophyll sweeper such as Bellossom to come in without fear of taking a hit. Block, in tandem with STAB Earthquake, gives Onix the capability of beating certain Pokemon such as Swalot one-on-one. Earthquake also prevents Onix from becoming overly passive. These last two moves are fairly situational, however, as Onix's main purpose is to set up the sun and bring in a teammate.</p>\n<p>Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature and a potential boost from Salac Berry improve Onix's odds of reliably setting up Sunny Day. 144 Attack EVs guarantee the KO with Explosion on Pidgeot, while the remaining 112 EVs go into HP to increase Onix's overall physical bulk so that it can switch into Pidgeot and other Flying-types repeatedly if need be. While Sturdy and Rock Head are both completely useless for Onix, Rock Head could be useful for certain Trace and Skill Swap users such as Porygon and Kecleon, which would suddenly no longer take recoil from Double-Edge. As such, Sturdy is Onix's better ability. Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Tropius make great teammates for Onix, as they greatly benefit from the offensive utility it provides. Fire-types such as Flareon can also make use of the sun Onix provides, as it gives a power boost to their STAB attacks. Spikes support from suicide lead Glalie is helpful, not necessarily for Onix but for sun hyper offense teams as a whole.</p>\n<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A lead set utilizing Endure over Block allows Onix to more reliably activate its Salac Berry, nearly guaranteeing that it can use Sunny Day. Be aware that Onix loses to a majority of opposing leads such as Glalie, Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, Magby, and Venomoth. Rock Slide can be used over Earthquake as Onix's attacking option, nailing Flying-types such as Murkrow and Pidgeot without having to sacrifice itself with Explosion prematurely. However, Onix has likely already set up Sunny Day by the time the aforementioned Flying-types have switched in, so it's okay if it sacrifices itself. Rock Slide is also less useful than Earthquake when up against Swalot, which can Rest off the damage more easily and KO Onix with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ground.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Opposing Chlorophyll users such as Tropius, Tangela, and Bellossom can all wreck Onix with Solar Beam, put it asleep with Sleep Powder, or set up Swords Dance in Tropius's case. Other Grass-types such as Roselia can also make quick work of Onix, although not quite as reliably. Water-types such as Wailord, Dewgong, Kingler, and Whiscash can douse Onix with Surf or Hydro Pump. Pelipper and Huntail are considerably dangerous, as Pelipper is immune to Earthquake and has immense physical bulk, while Huntail is slower than Onix and can set up Rain Dance after Onix uses Sunny Day to countersweep with Surf. Hitmonchan can deal massive damage with Sky Uppercut and pick off a weakened Onix with Mach Punch. However, Hitmonchan still takes a lot from Earthquake and Explosion. Electric-types such as Plusle and Pikachu carry Hidden Power Grass from time to time, nailing Whiscash, Graveler, Pupitar, and, of course, Onix. Even if they opt to run Hidden Power Ice, Onix will be severely crippled due to its pitifully low Special Defense stat.</p>\n"

Onix also possesses key resistances to Flying, Fire, and Poison, which makes it a great teammate for Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom and Tangela, which are predominantly Grass-type. However, using Onix has several downsides, such as the fact that it's fairly one-dimensional. Onix's Special Defense stat is also absolutely abysmal, leaving it susceptible to common special attackers such as Huntail and Chimecho. Lastly, Onix isn't that great because it only fulfills its niche on full sun teams, an archetype that isn't necessarily viable in NU.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This is your bog-standard Magneton: it &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot;,\nefficiently trapping and removing Skarmory and / or Forretress from the\nfray to allow powerful physical attackers to muscle their way through\nthe opposing team with no pesky Steel-types stopping them. Thunderbolt\nis a quintessential attribute for every Magneton set, providing a\npowerful STAB move for it to utilize, and is a good way to dispatch\nSkarmory. The choice of Hidden Power is dependent on Magneton's\nteammates. Hidden Power Grass is a valid option, though Magneton should\nbe used to form defensive holes in a team which is designed to\naccomodate Dragon Dance Salamence or CurseLax; the former sets up all\nover Forretress, and the latter forces it to unleash a weak Explosion.\nBoth are checked by Swampert (the latter only by Curse variants though),\nwhich Magneton can almost make short work of with Hidden Power Grass; it\ndoes around 90% to it, although Swampert will most likely be weakened\nenough for Hidden Power Grass to kill, as the most likely scenario is\nthat it has switched into one Hidden Power Flying from Salamence.\nHowever, Hidden Power Ice is also somewhat workable if Magneton is being\nused to support something like Dragon Dance Gyarados, which simply loves\nswitching into both Forretres and Swampert, but won't enjoy taking\nFlygon's Rock Slides as much; Magneton is slower than Flygon, so Hidden\nPower Ice must be used from either behind a Substitute or on a predicted\nswitch. Another reason to use Hidden Power Ice is that it covers Celebi\nand Dugtrio at the same time. Hidden Power Fire is a decent option in\nthat it allows Magneton to also vanquish Forretress. Hidden Power Fire\nMagneton is most suited for support teams which utilize powerful\nphysical sweepers such as Metagross and Choice Band Normal-types that\nare stopped by Forretress and Skarmory. Hidden Power Fire also gives\nMagneton-based teams a way to handle any Forretress using Spikes, as it\nis very uncommon to see Magneton alongside a spinner.</p>\n<p>Substitute is in the third slot because Magneton is able to force a\ndecent amount of switches offensively, and then either hit switch-ins\npowerfully or status the opponent from its safety behind a Substitute.\nOne of Magneton's few uses after Steel-type removal is switching in on a\npredicted switch to a bulky Water-type such as Milotic or Suicune,\nSubstituting on the predicted switch out to the appropriate Magneton\ncounter, and then choosing the appropriate move with no need to predict\nand strain the mind. The fourth slot can be filled with a variety of\nmoves and is comparatively unimportant, as Magneton will often only get\nthe chance to use one of its moves in a game situation due to the\nubiquity of Dugtrio. As Magneton beats the majority of common Steel- and\nPoison-types, Toxic is a decent option to cover things which it cannot\nfell with its attacking moves. Toxic is also notable because SubToxic\nMagneton can either almost kill Swampert or force it to Rest as long as\nSwampert switches in. Metal Sound is also fairly viable; it works best\nalongside Spikes support, but can also act as a deterrent to Calm Mind\nusers, such as Celebi, Raikou, Jirachi, and Blissey to an extent, who\nsee Magneton for the most part as setup fodder. Thunder Wave is also\nviable, although less so than other moves as Thunder Wave Magneton will\noften have no way to fight back against teams with the correct\nGround-type. However, it is great for taking the smirk off that\nSuperachi's face, and will often find other uses in battle situations.</p>\n<p>Magneton uses an uncomplicated EV spread that maximizes its\neffectiveness. 68 EVs are shifted into HP for that extra bit of generic\nbulk, but are rather irrelevant. A Modest nature and max Special Attack\nallows it to OHKO even the most specially defensive of Skarmory and\nForretress. Magneton can potentially go faster with a Timid nature and\nhit around 244-246 Speed, but in doing so it loses out on that key OHKO\non specially defensive Skarmory and Forretress. Magneton, if using\nHidden Power Fire, MUST use a Modest nature, as Timid Magneton fails to\nOHKO 252 / 252+ Forretress. When considering partners for Magneton, you\nshould not be thinking, &quot;what can your team do for Magneton?&quot;, but &quot;what\ncan Magneton do for your team?&quot; Magneton is an offensive trapping\nsupport Pokemon; it supports powerful physical attackers by trapping\ntheir counters. These physical attackers are Magneton's best partners.\nGyarados and Salamence are particularly notable as partners for\nMagneton, because as well as Magneton opens up teams to be mauled by the\npair, both aforementioned attackers share perfect type synergy with\nMagneton. Other physical attackers, such as Substitute Swords Dance\nHeracross, Swords Dance Heracross without Substitute, CurseLax, and\nTauros, also fit in well alongside Magneton, all gaining a buff to their\neffectiveness when Skarmory and Forretress are not present.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Rest and Sleep Talk increase Magneton's staying power throughout the\ngame by giving it a recovery method, albeit an unreliable one, and also\nallowing it to absorb Milotic and Gengar's multiple uses of Hypnosis and\nJynx's Lovely Kisses, certainly a desirable attribute if your team lacks\na sleep absorber. A Magneton with the given bulkier spread is able to\nswitch in relatively safely on all of the aforementioned three (with the\nexception being if Gengar carries the rather uncommon Fire Punch or\nFocus Punch). Thunderbolt and a Hidden Power of choice is preferred.\nGrass is preferable if Magneton is being used to assist something such\nas Dragon Dance Salamence, which positively sets up on Forretress (even\nsurviving an Intimidated Explosion), but will struggle to deal with\nSwampert; Ice is also quite useful if you need Magneton to be able to\nhurt both Celebi and Dugtrio at the same time, but Fire should be used\nif Magneton is being used to support something like Metagross or Tauros\nwhich will struggle muscling past Forretress, and also stopping\nForretress from easily laying down Spikes against the team. RestTalk\nMagneton is able to deter special attackers, such as non-Fire Punch or\nFocus Punching Gengar, RestTalk Zapdos, and Porygon2, due to its handy\nresistance to the BoltBeam combination, an attribute otherwise only held\nby the relatively uncommon Lanturn and Shedinja, whose viability is\nmassively nerfed due to the ubiquity of Tyranitar and the sandstorm it\nbrings about.</p>\n<p>16 Speed EVs on Magneton allow it to outspeed the surprisingly common 12\nand 8 Speed Skarmory, while a large chunk of investment in HP grants it\nall the bulk it can possibly have while still keeping the large Special\nAttack investment necessary to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory,\nForretress, and threaten RestTalk Zapdos outside of sand. An alternative\nEV spread for this set is 252 HP / 44 SpA / 204 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm\nnature. This spread allows Magneton to switch into Gengar and the rarer\noffensive Zapdos far better due to the increased investment in Special\nDefense, whilst still OHKOing standard physically defensive Skarmory\nwith Thunderbolt. However, it is a poor idea to rely on Magneton as a\nfull-time sole special wall due to its extreme vulnerability to Dugtrio.\nAnother issue with this spread is that specially defensive Skarmory will\nnot be OHKOed and thus Magneton is failing to do its most important job,\nand also that defensive RestTalk Zapdos only takes &quot;chip damage&quot; from\nthis spread. Especially outside of sand, Magneton will not have the\nnecessary firepower to threaten it and the pair will enter a drab and\npainful stall war, which will usually end up with Zapdos winning and\nMagneton literally struggling. Toxic can be used over a Hidden Power\nslot because nearly all switch-ins to RestTalk Magneton are not immune\nto it, and many things which are will be reluctant to take a\nThunderbolt. However, not using Hidden Power makes Magneton an even\nbigger goober to Dugtrio. Optimal partners for this set are physical\nsweepers which enjoy the absence of Skarmory and Forretress such as\nGyarados and Salamence. Other physical sweepers such as Swords Dance\nHeracross, CurseLax, and Tauros, will also have a much easier time\nsweeping with Steel-types gone.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>The main trouble with the common Magneton is the tendency to be seized\nby Dugtrio's moley clutches at inopportune times. What if Magneton could\nturn the tables on Dugtrio and send it tunneling away back to its Poke\nBall? This set is designed to complete exactly that function, and also\nafter doing so potentially set up a revenge kill for your own Dugtrio.\nIt is probably easiest to contextualize the moves on this set by\ninventing a common game scenario. After powering through Skarmory with a\nmerciless Thunderbolt, the opponent brings in Dugtrio with a twisted\ngrin smeared across his face as he clicks Earthquake. However, upon\nseeing the activation of a Salac Berry, the Dugtrio user adopts an\nexpression of pure unadulterated terror. Dugtrio then proceeds to switch\nout as Magneton uses Hidden Power Grass or Ice, as both are viable\noptions; Ice more so than on other sets due to Magneton's ability to\noutspeed Flygon after the activation of its Salac Berry. Hidden Power\nFire should not be used on EndSalac Magneton due to the fact that\nDugtrio is not OHKOed by it, and as such the purpose of the set is\ndefeated. Most likely, the opponent will then switch out to Snorlax,\nBlissey, or Celebi to finish Magneton off while taking comparatively\nlittle from its attacks. As Snorlax, Blissey, or Celebi finishes\nMagneton off, Magneton Screeches so that the Adamant Dugtrio which\nfollows up after Magneton's death can OHKO the aforementioned walls in\nsand\u2014and Celebi\u2014out of it.</p>\n<p>Magneton's EV spread is designed so that it is able to outspeed Jolly\nDugtrio at +1; maximum Speed investment comes two points short of\noutspeeding Timid Jolteon and Jolly Aerodactyl, and as such investing\n204 Speed EVs is the most efficient spread. EndSalac Magneton is\ndesigned to be partnered with Dugtrio; the three moles are an essential\nteammate for this set, being a pivotal part of the strategy, as\nexplained in the Set Comments. For the Screech + Dugtrio strategy to\nwork at its best, Tyranitar's Sand Stream is very helpful in order to\nturn Dugtrio's close-to-OHKOs to OHKOs, such as those on -2 Blissey and\nSnorlax. Other teammates for EndSalac Magneton are those who can\ncapitalize on the lack of walls, such as Skarmory and Celebi, which are\nremoved by the pair. Standard Calm Mind Celebi, Dragon Dance Gyarados,\nand RestTalk CurseLax are examples of those who profit from the havoc\nwreaked and defensive holes punched by MagTrio. Magneton can also forgo\nScreech and use Metal Sound or a status move instead if Dugtrio is not\nbeing used, but despite being able to sweep sometimes late-game, the\nprimary aim of this set is to work alongside Dugtrio and give it an\neasier time.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>The concept of Magneton is a very simple one. Magneton is used on teams\nwhich benefit from the removal of Skarmory, and to a lesser extent the\nremoval of Forretress; generally those teams centered around physical\nsweepers, such as Gyarados, Substitute + Swords Dance Heracross, and\nCurseLax, which struggle with Skarmory. Magneton can also be used to\ncomplement teams which use Skarmory to lay down Spikes, removing the\ncommon Rapid Spin user Forretress with Hidden Power Fire and allowing\nSkarmory to lay Spikes freely. However, those sorts of teams will\nmassively struggle with a smartly played Cloyster, and as such are\nrather unreliable. Magneton overall should not be seen as a linchpin of\na team, but as a tool used to increase the damage output and overall\noffensive effectiveness of a team's key members by removing their\nlargest counters.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, other than its designated Steel-trapping role, Magneton\nstruggles to counter anything notable, despite its slew of resistances.\nThis is largely due to very mediocre stats, and a crippling 4x weakness\nto the very common Ground-type moves. A RestTalk set can check most\nGengar variants and RestTalk Zapdos with the correct investment, but\notherwise Magneton, especially offensive variants, is largely a\none-for-one trade if there are Steels to trap, and if there are not, it\ncan often be a burdensome waste of a teamslot. The way to play Magneton\nin general is to play very conservatively before it has completed its\nfunction of Steel-type trapping and removal, and very aggressively after\nit has done so, freely sacrificing it unless it is needed to take a\nsleep-inducing move, or act as death or Wish fodder. RestTalk Magneton\nis an exception to the above statement. In a world of ideals, Magneton\nshould attempt to get in on the Steel-type which it needs to trap on a\npredicted double switch. This is because high-standard opponents are\nlikely to Whirlwind first with their Skarmory\u2014or even worse, Earthquake\nwith their Forretress\u2014to check for the magnetic trio as opposed to\nblindly using Spikes, and if Magneton is switched into Skarmory again,\nit could be possibly met with a well-timed switch to Dugtrio.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>There are two moves that should be universally resident on Magneton\nsets\u2014Thunderbolt and a Hidden Power of some ilk. Most of the viable\noptions for the remaining two moveslots are listed in the above sets,\nbut there are a few viable moves which could potentially be used.\nProtect has potential to be used above Substitute in conjunction with\nToxic on Magneton's offensive set, but many things which Magneton\nconnects with Toxic on the switch\u2014Swampert and Claydol\u2014are slower than\nan invested Magneton, and as such Substitute generally works better to\nstall for poison damage or force a Rest, due to the fact that Substitute\ncan be used repeatedly without risk. However, Toxic in conjunction with\nProtect can potentially be effective for getting &quot;chip damage&quot; on a\nFlygon switch-in. Magneton can potentially use two status moves\u2014Thunder\nWave and Toxic\u2014on the same set. Despite the supposed &quot;increased utility&quot;\nof such a set, in fact a double status set is rather pointless due to\nthe fact that Magneton, in a normal game scenario, will generally only\nbe able to use a status move once (or not at all) due to its frailty and\nas such poor switch-in capability on offensive moves. Magneton can also\nset up your screen of choice to help provide support for a sweeper after\nit bites the dust, although dual screens setup offense is a poorer\nstrategy in ADV than later gens due to the fact that the immediate power\nof the offensive powerhouses of ADV is comparatively lower, as well as\nthe ubiquity of bulky phazers. Magneton certainly isn't going to work as\na bulky screening pivot. Screech can be used on non-Endure sets, but it\nis nowhere near as effective as on Endure sets.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Like many other commonly seen Pokemon, Magneton carries the onus of\nbeing trapped and killed by Dugtrio. The moley cluster can either get in\non Magneton on a predicted Thunderbolt, a smart double switch, or when\navenging the death of its Steel-type teammate, prevent it from escape\nwith its excellent ability Arena Trap, and bump it off with Earthquake.\nHowever, when switching into the magnetic trio, Dugtrio must take care\nto avoid coming in on Hidden Power or Substitute, especially if it has\nbeen revealed previously to the Magneton user. Magneton can also force\nDugtrio back out of the fray with Endure and a Salac Berry. Magneton is\nstopped cold by special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax (especially\nEarthquake versions), although the latter will eventually be forced to\nRest by repeated Thunderbolts, and may have a hard time, especially in\nsand. Calm Mind Celebi merrily sets up on Magneton, but may struggle\nagainst Metal Sound variants with Hidden Power Fire or Ice.</p>\n<p>Other Ground-types also work well to counter Magneton due to its 4x\nweakness to their STAB Earthquakes, although they must be wary of super\neffective Hidden Powers. Flygon is probably the best to switch straight\ninto Magneton, as Hidden Power Ice is the least seen listed Hidden Power\non Magneton, and Flygon outspeeds Magneton and as such cannot be\nSubToxic stalled. Claydol makes an excellent Magneton counter due to its\nlack of 4x weaknesses to certain Hidden Powers and its high Special\nDefense stat. However, a Claydol without Rest may struggle against\nMagneton if the Magneton uses Toxic on the switch. Swampert, especially\nRestTalk variants, work well enough against Magneton as long as the\npossibility of Hidden Power Grass is respected. Ironically enough,\nSteelix works very well against Magneton with its immunity to both Toxic\nand Thunderbolt, and the fact that Magneton hits it only neutrally with\nHidden Power Grass or Ice. Fire Punch or Focus Punching Gengar can lure\nMagneton in and hurt it badly. A good sector of the metagame can come\ninto Magneton after it has trapped and killed a Steel-type and revenge\nkill it. In reality, it's not so much a case of countering Magneton, but\na case of simply attacking when it is predicted to switch in and beating\nit down continually.</p>\n",

Forretress, on the\nother hand, can barely touch them outside of Explosion, Hidden Power, or\nZap Cannon. Furthermore, Skarmory is a better bet against most physical\nhitters, as it is immune to Ground, resists Flying, and 4x resists Bug,\nwhile Forretress takes neutral damage from Ground and Flying and only\nhas a 2x resistance to Bug. Forretress has the slight advantage of\nhaving only one weakness as opposed to Skarmory's two, namely to Fire\nand Electric.

For instance, Light Screen enables\nForretress to survive Magneton's Hidden Power Fire and OHKO it with\nEarthquake. Forretress survives even attacks from +6 Snorlax and OHKOes\nit with Counter. Hidden Power Flying lets Forretress take on Heracross\nand Breloom.

Mightyena needs to be paired with a Spiker to function properly; Roselia is an optimal choice, thanks to not only having no overlapping type weaknesses, unlike Glalie and Cacturne, but also having access to reliable recovery using Synthesis. Furthermore, Roselia sports the best bulk out of all three of NU's Spikers, fitting best on the defensively oriented teams Mightyena enjoys being used on. Mightyena also needs a bulky spinblocker to keep Spikes in play and check the most prominent Rapid Spin user, Hitmonchan. Sableye is ideal for this.

However, Mightyena is quite passive, not only losing one-on-one against three of the strongest Pokemon in the tier, Hitmonchan, Huntail, and Flareon, but also struggling in matchups against Roselia, Mawile, and the majority of special attackers.

This is because nothing takes more in\nUbers from Hidden Power Flying than it does from Hidden Power\nBug/Earthquake (well, after STAB, Hidden Power Flying is 105, Earthquake\nis only 100, but they're practically the same), but Hidden Power Bug and\nGhost are super effective against a whole lot of the Psychic-based uber\nmetagame. Choice Banded Hidden Power Bug hurts. Don't believe me? Here\nare some numbers:</p>\n<p>Latias and Latios are OHKOed without Defense or HP EVs (standard). In\nfact, Latias needs 240 HP EVs to have guaranteed survival. Latios is\neven worse off. If it wants to be certain of surviving a single hit, it\nneeds not only 252 HP EVs, but an additional 72 Defense EVs.</p>\n<p>Another major difference between this and the old standard (252 Attack /\n252 Speed, Adamant) is how much bulkier this is. The main reason is\nExeggutor. Rayquaza makes a good switch-in to Exeggutor, because its\nability means that it blocks sunlight, so Solar Beam takes two turns,\nand Chlorophyll is nullified. This means that if you switch in on a\nSolar Beam, you are faster and can OHKO it, while it can't do anything.\nThis puts a powerful foe out of commission. The EVs are to let it\nsurvive max damage Modest Exeggutor Hidden Power Ice in case they guess\nwhat you're up to. This will also survive Choice Band Adamant Groudon /\nRayquaza Rock Slide every time and can take 2 Choice Banded Rayquaza\nExtreme Speeds.</p>\n<p>An alternate EV spread can be used to make your Rayquaza fast. If you\ngive it Jolly and max Speed, it is faster than all Groudon and Kyogre\nand also beats the few Latias and Latios remaining that just put in 307\nSpeed. Obviously, you'd want to max Attack as well.</p>\n"

There isn't really much else Deoxys-A can survive to do.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>For a Choice Band user, max Attack and max Speed. For the Substitute set, max Special Attack and max Speed along with Mild is probably best. On either of them, a +Speed nature is also good because it beats out Exeggutor and other Deoxys-A (only with Extreme Speed, or it's pointless to beat out the other Deoxys-A, who will likely just Extreme Speed, and if they don't have Extreme Speed, they switch out). Considering the rarity of Timid Mewtwo (as it beats nothing that's used on 95% of teams that Modest doesn't), you could go down to 360 Speed and still beat out Modest Mewtwo to give you more EVs for a mixed sweeper set.</p>\n<p>Always use a Defense hindering nature if you're using two types of attacks. You obviously won't want to lower one of the attacking stats, and Deoxys-A needs all the Speed it can get. So it comes down to lowering Deoxys-A's Defense or Special Defense. There isn't a used physical attack that Deoxys-A will survive, regardless of nature, except maybe the rare Superpower from Deoxys-D. However, Deoxys-A can survive Pursuit (if it doesn't switch) from Metagross and Knock Off from Deoxys-D. If you'll notice, all of these are Dark attacks, meaning they run off the Special Attack stat. Knock Off does 29-34% to Deoxys-A, assuming Deoxys-D has no Special Attack EVs. This is almost always a 4HKO. It does 32-37% to a Deoxys-A with a Special Defense hindering nature, which is almost always a 3HKO. If Deoxys-A stays in on a Metagross with no Special Attack EVs and a Special Attack neutral nature, it can sometimes survive even with three layers of Spikes down and always with two layers down (72-84% damage). This is not the case for a Special Defense hindering nature Deoxys-A. Deoxys-A can also survive Lugia's Ice Beam by 5% at the least if its nature is neutral, but with a Special Defense hindering nature, Deoxys-A often dies. Even Psycho Boost Lugia doesn't have a guaranteed OHKO without Special Attack EVs (lots of Lugia don't have any, because of all the defense needed).</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Deoxys-D can do a moderate job against non Shadow Ball ones, but really,\nwow. This thing has amazing Attack and Special Attack stats, and a great\nmovepool to take advantage of those stats.</p>\n<p>Ninjask is faster than Deoxys-A if Ninjask is Jolly or if Deoxys-A isn't\nHasty and can OHKO with any of its attacks. It can only come in on\nSuperpower (Choice Banded is a 3HKO), Solar Beam, and Calm Mind, though.\nIt can actually damage many other Ubers with that STAB Bug attack, so\nit's not entirely useless outside of stopping a Deoxys-A sweep. It is\nstill at risk of dying to Extreme Speed, however. Dodrio and Swellow can\nkill Deoxys-A with Quick Attack; have a perfectly safe switch in on\nShadow Ball, the most commonly used move on physical Deoxys-A; and can\nuse Return or Double-Edge if Deoxys-A is Choice Banded, which seriously\nhurts most Pokemon. Arcanine can switch into anything Deoxys-A throws at\nit, save Psycho Boost, thanks to Intimidate, and use Extreme Speed, but\nit is really easy to switch out of. Rayquaza is probably the best\ncounter, as the Choice Band user is the most common and a lot of people\nstill haven't caught on to using Ice Beam as the last move, so it's a\nfairly safe switch-in. However, you have to beware of the Substitute /\nIce Beam set, because it sets up a Substitute as you switch to Rayquaza,\nand then you have to switch out because of the Ice Beam threat. Pursuit\nMetagross can stop Deoxys-A after the initial kill with 100% safety\n(unless it has Thunder in the rain or Fire Punch in the sun and stays\nin) or can come in on anything from the Choice Band user but +Attack\nSuperpower. With Spikes down, Choice Band Trapinch can come in after\nDeoxys-A kills something and use Quick Attack, unless it's using Choice\nBand Extreme Speed, in which case Trapinch dies even with max Defense.</p>\n",

To demonstrate a situation where Overheat can come in handy: with a Modest nature, Charmeleon will always OHKO max HP Glalie with Fire Blast, but with a Timid nature, that drops to about a 50% chance, while Overheat stays at a 100% chance to OHKO. So, depending on the nature choice and the target, having both Fire Blast and Overheat available is nice to do what Charmeleon wants to\u2014which is blow stuff away.</p>\n<p>Hidden Power Grass shreds apart the Rock- and Water-types that would otherwise be able to switch into Charmeleon's Fire-type attacks, notably easily 2HKOing Whiscash. Dragon Claw fills out the last slot as a great super effective hit on Shelgon, preventing it from using Charmeleon as setup bait, as well as getting a decent neutral hit on Flareon and other Fire-types. Rock Slide is a good alternative that deals significantly more damage to Flareon even with a -Atk nature at the cost of missing out on Shelgon and the rare Dragonair.

Charcoal boosts the power of Charmeleon's Fire-type moves even more, which works best when using a Timid nature to make up for some of the lost power. Charmeleon's available special movepool is pretty barren apart from the given moves above. Flamethrower is available as a guaranteed safe move and is usable over Overheat, but the drop in power is pretty significant. Hidden Power Water is usable as a super effective hit on Rock- and Fire-types, but Charmeleon then has almost no way of combating Water-types, making it easy setup prey for dangerous threats like Huntail. Finally, Toxic is always available to cripple Flareon and other special walls in the long run.</p>\n<p>Flareon and Magcargo give this set a hard time even if you choose to run Rock Slide, making your own Water- and Rock-types like Seadra and Relicanth good teammates.

That said, it isn't exactly easy to wall, which makes it a good fit on heavy offense teams that want a hard-hitting Fire-type that's quite a bit faster than Flareon.

However, the one move that really stands out in Charmeleon's movepool is Belly Drum, which can be super dangerous under the right circumstances, as Charmeleon is fast and threatening enough to guarantee itself a Substitute in most situations and begin setting up. With a moveset of Belly Drum / Substitute / Return / Rock Slide while holding a Salac Berry, Charmeleon could prove to be pretty threatening even without any physical STAB attacks. Unfortunately, even at +6, Charmeleon will lose to physical stalwarts like Relicanth, which can still avoid the 2HKO from Rock Slide or Return and can easily OHKO back. For the same reasons, a Swords Dance or SubPunch set can do some damage under the right circumstances but require way too much support to pull off properly and are stopped cold by popular physical walls.</p>\n<p>Finally, Sunny Day is an option to boost Charmeleon's Fire power and help support Chlorophyll sweepers like Bellossom. Under sun, Charmeleon has a really good chance to OHKO Hitmonchan with Overheat, which is guaranteed with a layer of Spikes, and Charmeleon even has a small chance to 2HKO 252 / 252+ Dewgong with Fire Blast. Unfortunately, Charmeleon lacks Solar Beam or anything else to benefit from the sun, but it also comes with the benefit of weakening Water-type attacks directed its way.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Kecleon is an almost complete stop to any special Charmeleon set and can proceed to either paralyze it with Thunder Wave and make Charmeleon useless or simply 2HKO it with Return.

They probably can't do much in return, but they will ultimately outlast Charmeleon. Wailord, Pelipper, and other Water-types that can avoid the 4x hit from Hidden Power Grass are other really good switch-ins to Charmeleon and can easily OHKO it with their STAB Water-type moves. Most of the Pokemon that can outspeed Charmeleon can also threaten it, including Pidgeot, Murkrow, Plusle, and Haunter.

This is particularly useful when Graveler is being used as the team's primary check to Flying- and Normal-types, which will be running coverage specifically for Graveler and other Rock-types.</p>\n<p>Toxic is an option on this set, more so with Leftovers than Choice Band, to cripple the bulky Water-types that are likely to switch into Graveler. Toxic is also a good safety move in general, as Poison-types are highly unlikely to switch into Graveler. Graveler should only be chosen over other Rock-types for a team to make use of its secondary Ground typing, which brings an Electric immunity and a powerful STAB Earthquake to the table over the likes of Relicanth and Sudowoodo. Therefore, teammates that are weak to Electric, such as Pidgeot and Huntail, are ideal and both appreciate Graveler's ability to blow through sturdy checks like Mawile and Kecleon.</p>\n<p>Graveler is exceptionally weak to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks, being OHKOed by most of them, so unless you can time Explosion well to eliminate these threats as they come in, good defensive teammates are needed so that Graveler can switch out safely. Specially defensive Flareon, Venomoth, and Murkrow are good teammates to switch into Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle are a good option to remove Water-type attackers. Finally, Hitmonchan can switch into Rock Slide rather easily and KO Graveler in return with Sky Uppercut, making Pokemon like Haunter, Chimecho, and Flying-types valuable teammates as well.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Graveler is one of many Rock-types in the tier, but it separates itself from the pack by getting STAB on Earthquake, carrying Explosion in its back pocket, and being immediately stronger and physically bulkier than Pupitar. What's more, it has a great base 95 Attack stat which is made even better when backed by a Choice Band, and Graveler makes a good check to the multitude of Normal- and Flying-types of the tier. However, Graveler needs to be very wary of Hidden Power Grass that's often carried on sets specifically to take it, Relicanth, and Whiscash out in one move. It's also extremely slow, and despite its advantages, it faces stiff competition from Sudowoodo and Relicanth for the Rock-type team slot as they are much more flexible in their movesets, sport better defensive stats and typings that make them less susceptible to their foe's coverage moves, and provide all-around better team synergy than Graveler.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A defensive set is certainly viable, as Graveler packs the typing and bulk to check Normal-, Flying-, and Poison-types throughout a game. However, a full defensive set is almost entirely outclassed by Relicanth due to its higher bulk and slightly better typing. A SubPunch set is powerful, but less useful on Graveler than on Sudowoodo due to Graveler getting STAB on Earthquake. As for individual moves, Counter can be a nice tool to use, but most of its targets are going to be hit harder by Rock Slide or Earthquake. Finally, Rock Tomb can allow a teammate to initiate a sweep against a target like Vigoroth, but most times the higher damage output from Rock Slide is just going to be more useful, and the only major target that Graveler is going to outspeed itself after using Rock Tomb is Dewgong.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The best initial check to Graveler is any Water-type with decent physical bulk; examples include Wailord, Whiscash, and Kingler. The Graveler user won't typically Explode immediately, so they will usually have a safe first switch in and can easily OHKO with any Water move. Defensive Tangela is probably the best overall counter to Graveler, and it really only fears Explosion, since it can shrug off Hidden Power Bug from full health, and if Graveler uses Hidden Power Bug that just opens up an easy switch-in opportunity for a large portion of the tier. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and can KO Graveler with Sky Uppercut, but it can't risk switching into Earthquake.</p>\n<p>Relicanth and other Rock-types can switch into Rock Slide and particularly Explosion easily enough, but they must be very wary of Earthquake. If Graveler is locked into Earthquake, then Chimecho, Haunter, Pelipper, and a whole mess of other Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate can switch in for free. Choice Band Diglett can trap and OHKO Graveler with Earthquake after a layer of Spikes but cannot switch into it at all. Finally, there are a lot of Pokemon that can easily fit Hidden Power Grass onto their moveset to eliminate Graveler specifically, such as Murkrow and Plusle, and even weak ones from the likes of Pidgeot will do a massive amount of damage to Graveler.</p>\n",

It often can't be phazed,\nand even the best walls can't block it. Of course, there's Mewtwo, which\nis way better than Mew in almost every way. If you're using Mew, be sure\nto take advantage of its unique movepool, because unless you're using\none of those moves, Mewtwo can do just about anything Mew can do, but\nbetter.

The idea is simply to get Bellossom in, set up Sunny Day, and pummel the foe with Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire. Sleep Powder is Bellossom's ace in the hole, allowing it to safely switch out of a dangerous situation or potentially break through a foe that it wouldn't normally have a chance against, such as Golbat or Flareon. With Sunny Day up, Bellossom safely outspeeds the entire tier unless the opponent is packing Tangela, and Hidden Power Fire gains a pseudo-STAB boost to give Bellossom great two-move coverage. The major downside to using Bellossom as a weather sweeper compared to its main competition in Huntail is that Bellossom is fairly vulnerable without Sunny Day up; Solar Beam needs to charge without sun and Hidden Power Fire is pretty weak.</p>\n<p>With the given EV spread, Bellossom is as strong as possible while outspeeding the entire tier with Sunny Day up. A Timid nature is certainly doable, as it allows Bellossom to at worst Speed tie other Bellossom in the sun and outspeed as much as possible before setting up Sunny Day, giving it the chance to potentially put something like Modest Huntail or maximum Speed Octillery to sleep with Sleep Powder beforehand. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 100 SpA / 52 SpD / 104 Spe with a Modest nature allows Bellossom to completely avoid the 2HKO from Timid Huntail's Ice Beam while still outspeeding the tier in the sun. The only move on this set that's replaceable is Sleep Powder, which should only be done if sleep moves make an appearance elsewhere on your team. If this is the case, Sleep Powder can be replaced with Moonlight to give Bellossom a ton of longevity in and out of the sun. It can also be replaced with a secondary Grass-type STAB move such as Giga Drain so that Bellossom isn't quite so vulnerable out of the sun.</p>\n<p>Bellossom 2HKOes a decent portion of the tier but OHKOes very little, highlighting the importance of making sure that Bellossom is saved for the late-game once the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Flareon and other Fire-types present the largest roadblock to successfully sweeping with Bellossom, as they take a pittance from Bellossom's attacks and gain a super boost to their STAB moves in the sun. Hitmonchan thus makes a good teammate, as it can switch into and weaken or KO the Fire-types in the tier with Earthquake, as well as take on other special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung with its Fighting-type STAB moves. A special mention needs to go to Diglett here, as it can trap and KO the Fire-types in the tier thanks to Arena Trap, as well as take out Swalot and Arbok, guaranteeing they are out of the way for Bellossom later in the match. Flying-types also present a tough obstacle for Bellossom, making a lure like Stun Spore Venomoth a good teammate to cripple them.</p>\n"

This set should be used on teams that need a solid counter to Huntail, Haunter, and Plusle in one slot, which other similar specially bulky Pokemon like Dewgong and Flareon cannot provide. Otherwise, Roselia will probably fit better on teams in this Bellossom's place due to the Spikes it provides. Sleep Powder is one of the major draws to using Bellossom, and it is almost non-negotiable on this set in order to cripple dangerous offensive Pokemon looking to use Bellossom as setup bait. Giga Drain is recommended as the primary STAB move due to the secondary healing it provides, although Hidden Power Grass is a viable alternative, as it is stronger and has way more PP. Stun Spore pairs very well with Sleep Powder and can cripple common switch-ins to Bellossom like Murkrow to allow for a teammate to sweep later in the match. Toxic is a good alternative in the third slot, as it will allow Bellossom to beat other defensive Pokemon like Sableye and Chimecho one-on-one. The last slot goes to Moonlight to provide Bellossom with a reliable source of healing and allow it to effectively counter Huntail throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Maximum Special Defense investment is recommended so that Bellossom is bulky enough to take on Huntail and other special attackers throughout the match. Some Defense investment can be run so that Bellossom is better equipped to check the Rock-types in the tier, although Bellossom requires significant investment to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth and Graveler, and at that point you're probably better off using Tangela. Protect is the most prominent alternative that should be put over Moonlight, as it can help Bellossom stall for Toxic damage and scout Choice Band attackers' moves. Hidden Power Fire is usable in the last moveslot to ward off opposing Grass- and Bug-types that will otherwise have an easy switch into Bellossom, particularly Roselia, since it also doesn't mind status thanks to Natural Cure.</p>\n<p>Defensive Bellossom fits best on balance teams as part of a defensive backbone to support frailer attackers that need a safety net against a variety of special threats in a single teamslot. With Bellossom covering these, a physically defensive teammate is needed to complete the core. Relicanth is highly recommended for this reason, as they have fantastic synergy together; Sableye and Wailord are also good teammates to consider. Bellossom tends to force a lot of switches because of the status that it throws out, meaning it fits particularly well on Spikes-centered teams. To avoid stacking type weaknesses, Glalie therefore makes the best Spiker to pair with Bellossom. Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to Liquid Ooze and its fantastic special bulk, making a teammate that can eliminate it like Chimecho or Piloswine much appreciated. Chimecho also helps significantly with Roselia, and in return Bellossom covers Huntail and Dark-type attacks aimed Chimecho.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Bellossom is awesome. Despite facing direct competition from Tangela as a Sunny Day sweeper, Bellossom has risen above its competition due to its high special bulk, good speed and power, and access to Sleep Powder. Tangela's perks are that it is faster and a little stronger, but Bellossom's higher bulk allows it to set up on and countersweep one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier: Huntail. This trait alone gives Bellossom a major niche in a tier sorely lacking in solid answers to the rain menace. While Bellossom is typically seen as a Sunny Day sweeper, it also has a very effective specially defensive set that can counter some very dangerous Pokemon in the tier, including Chimecho, Plusle, and Haunter. Overall, Bellossom is a solid pick in NU and is worth building a team around.</p>\n",

Roselia is a huge roadblock that would need to be overcome before attempting to bring this set, but with it gone Bellossom could wreak havoc on slower teams. Hidden Power Psychic is Bellossom's best move for a few of its common switch-ins such as Swalot, Arbok, Golbat, Haunter, Roselia, and Hitmonchan, but this comes at the cost of being completely walled by Steel-types and gives Murkrow a much safer switch in. RestTalk can be used to make Bellossom very durable and more carefree about status, but Bellossom's biggest highlights are access to Sleep Powder and Moonlight, both of which don't work too well on a RestTalk set. Swords Dance can be used, and Bellossom actually has a decent Attack stat to make use of it, but Bellossom has a pretty barren physical movepool that includes only Return, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power. Finally, Petal Dance or Magical Leaf can be used anywhere Giga Drain and Hidden Power Grass are mentioned, but the secondary healing and higher power of the latter two are more desirable compared to the locked-in nature of Petal Dance and the lower power of Magical Leaf.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Swalot, particularly RestTalk variants, utterly walls Bellossom to kingdom come.

Flareon and Torkoal only dislike the status that Bellossom can throw their way, and in return they can completely roast Bellossom with their Fire-type STAB moves. Murkrow will take a decent chunk of damage from Bellossom's attacking moves, but it's immune to Sleep Powder and will annihilate Bellossom with Drill Peck. Pidgeot and Golbat have an easier time switching into Bellossom save for not being immune to Sleep Powder and can threaten back with Aerial Ace. Arbok and Seviper can tank anything Bellossom can throw at them (Seviper even has a chance to activate Shed Skin to get rid of Sleep Powder), and in return they'll KO Bellossom with Sludge Bomb. Kecleon can be taken advantage of because of Color Change, but it will be able to easily tank any of Bellossom's moves and retaliate with Return or Thunder Wave. Venomoth, Glalie, and Roselia will take a decent chunk of damage from Hidden Power Fire, especially in the sun, but outside it they can threaten Bellossom back with their STAB moves.</p>\n",

With an incredible HP stat,\na great Special Defense stat, and a workable Special Attack stat,\nBlissey shines as a special tank that can not only take any special\nattack thrown at her, but can also sweep. Calm Mind is obviously needed,\nboosting Blissey's Special Attack to incredible levels and her Special\nDefense to unbreakable levels. Soft-Boiled allows Blissey to thrive\nthroughout the match, ensuring that it can check the plethora of special\nattackers in the metagame. The last two moveslots depend on what you are\nwilling to lose to and want to beat. If using Thunderbolt, you need to\nbe using Ice Beam; when using the two aforementioned moves, Blissey has\na harder time beating Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi, Swampert, and Tyranitar.\nHowever, with Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, Blissey can also serve as a\ncheck to Salamence and Gyarados lacking Choice Band. With Flamethrower,\nHidden Power Grass is a must; when using the two previously mentioned\nmoves, Blissey will now lose to Salamence and Gyarados in exchange for\nmore comfortably beating Jirachi, Swampert, Metagross, and Tyranitar.\nWhen choosing the final two moveslots it's a good idea to look at your\nteam and see what Pokemon are more threatening for it. Regardless of the\nfinal two moveslots you choose, Blissey will still do a great job of\nchecking any special attacker that comes your way.</p>\n<p>Maximum Special Attack investment is mandatory so that Blissey is\ndealing as much damage as possible; most notably, maximum Special Attack\ninvestment and a Modest nature OHKOes all Dugtrio variants. Maximum\nDefense investment is necessary to tank physical hits from Pokemon\nlacking a Choice Band, as well as having any chance of avoiding a 2HKO\nfrom Choice Band Dugtrio. A Modest nature is good for dealing as much\ndamage as possible, while a Bold nature is viable for tanking physical\nhits with greater ease. As far as moveset changes, you really need to\nstick with the given set. Wish is the only move that could be changed,\nhowever, being able to instantly heal Blissey is generally more\nimportant than keeping your teammates healthy. Fire Blast, Thunder, and\nBlizzard may seem viable, but their lack of PP and mediocre accuracy,\nespecially in Thunder and Blizzard's case, really lowers their\nviability.</p>\n<p>Since Blissey has a lot of trouble with physical attackers, some of her\nbest partners are ones that can defeat powerful Pokemon that target her\npitiful Defense stat. Will-O-Wisp Gengar is a great partner as it can\ncripple the physical attackers that Blissey hates and can switch into\nSnorlax with relative ease. Skarmory is an excellent Blissey partner as\nit can switch into nearly every physical attacker in the metagame with\nease, set up Spikes, and proceed to wear down physical attackers with\nresidual damage from Spikes. Also, Blissey covers all the special\nthreats that Skarmory can't deal with, namely Gengar and Fire Punch\nJirachi. When looking at optimal Blissey partners, it's best to look at\nPokemon that can either defeat most physical attackers like Suicune,\ncripple physical attackers like Gengar, or wall them like Skarmory.</p>\n"

On more\noffensive teams, Cleric Blissey is useful for removing a burn from\nSnorlax that may have been given to Snorlax by a Gengar, paralysis on a\nSalamence, and other status. Soft-Boiled is a must on all Blissey sets,\nensuring that she is healthy enough to survive throughout the match.\nSeismic Toss is Blissey's most reliable way of dealing damage to\nopposing Pokemon.

As for the last moveslot, there are a number of\nlegitimate options. Ice Beam is preferred by many players as it allows\nBlissey to beat Dugtrio. Additionally, Ice Beam lets Blissey hurt\nGengar, as well as OHKO Salamence. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling\na lot of Blissey's more offensive switch-ins, namely Gyarados and\nTyranitar. Also, with paralysis support, your team may be more adept at\nchecking the powerful special attackers that Cleric Blissey can't\nnormally beat, such as Calm Mind + Leech Seed Celebi. Finally, Toxic is\nuseful for halting a Celebi's sweep, forcing a Suicune to rest\nprematurely, as well as crippling other Pokemon that don't appreciate\nToxic like Tyranitar.</p>\n<p>The EV spread allows Blissey to OHKO standard Salamence, 3HKO Zapdos in\nsand, 3HKO standard Celebi in sand, and OHKO all Dugtrio. If you're not\nusing Ice Beam, move the Special Attack EVs to Defense. There's no need\nto invest in Blissey's Special Defense stat since it's so big; by\ninvesting more HP into Defense, Blissey will find more opportunities to\nheal itself, support her team with Aromatherapy, and spread status.\nAlthough Cleric Blissey is a much more defensive than her Calm Mind\ncounterpart, standard teammates still apply. Will-O-Wisp Gengar is a\ngood partner for switching to the Fighting-type attacks that Blissey\nlures in, and burning physical attackers that threaten Blissey. Skarmory\nis a good partner, as it can take nearly all the physical attacks that\nBlissey hates, with the exception of STAB Fighting-type attacks; set up\nSpikes, and defeat physical attackers with Hidden Power Flying, Drill\nPeck, or Toxic.</p>\n"

Wish is what\nseparates this Blissey set from the other ones, ensuring that your team\nis healthy throughout the battle. The second moveslot comes down to\npreference. Protect is useful for scouting for attacks, receiving a\nWish, and many other things. Although it may seem silly to use\nSoft-Boiled and Wish on the same set, being able to recover half of your\nHP instantly is very important. When using Wish and Protect, it gives\nyour opponent a free switch in to Choice Band Pokemon, Calm Mind users,\nand other threatening attackers. With Soft-Boiled, there's fewer turns\nthat a powerful attackers can switch in. Seismic Toss is mandatory on\nall Blissey lacking Calm Mind, as Seismic Toss enables Blissey to check\nRaikou, offensive Jirachi, and many other special attackers more\nefficiently. For the final moveslot, Ice Beam is preferred for slamming\nCelebi, Zapdos, and most importantly Dugtrio, ensuring that the\nthree-headed mole can't trap and 2HKO Blissey with ease. Thunder Wave is\nuseful for crippling offensive Pokemon that rely on their Speed, such as\nDragon Dance Tyranitar, while Toxic is useful for drastically limiting\nthe survivability of any Pokemon hit with the aforementioned status.</p>\n<p>If not using Ice Beam, move the Special Attack EVs into HP and make the\nnature Bold. There's no need to invest in Special Defense because\nBlissey already has an enormous Special Defense stat. With more EVs\ninvested in Defense, Blissey will find more opportunities to switch into\nnon-boosted physical attackers and support her team with Wish. As far as\nteammates go, Choice Band Pokemon are amongst WishBliss's best\nteammates. One of the most major and intrinsic flaws of all Choice Band\nPokemon is that they lack recovery; often times, Choice Band Pokemon\nwill have to deal with residual damage from Spikes, Sand Stream, or they\nwill be forced to take resisted attacks in order for them to switch in.\nAfter a while, the damage racks up and you may find yourself with a\nweakened Choice Band Pokemon. Luckily, Blissey is able to heal all your\nChoice Band Pokemon, ensuring that they can bring the pain for an\nextended period of time. Other than Choice Band Pokemon, the teammates\nlisted earlier are just as viable. Will-O-Wisp Gengar nearly neutralizes\nall physical attackers while Skarmory and Blissey form an incredible\ndefensive duo capable of checking a very large portion of the metagame.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Blissey is nothing short of incredible. Most if not all special\nattackers are useless against Blissey's insane HP stat and incredible\nSpecial Defense stat; even some physical attackers have trouble getting\npast Blissey's tough HP stat, despite her pitiful Defense stat. However,\nunlike other Pokemon with incredibly defensive stats like Dusclops,\nBlissey can pose a serious offensive threat. With Calm Mind and a myriad\nof offensive options such as Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, Blissey\ncan sweep through teams once powerful physical attackers are weakened or\ndefeated. Additionally, as if Blissey wasn't good enough, it also has if\nnot the best then one of the best movepools in the entire game. Need a\ncleric? Blissey has Aromatherapy. Need Wish support? Blissey has Wish!</p>\n<p>Although Blissey is an incredible Pokemon, there's a reason it's not\nfound on every team. Blissey's main problem is her lack of an immediate\noffensive presence. Snorlax and Regice, while being significantly worse\nspecially defensive walls than Blissey, have strong offensive traits\nthat allow them to threaten most Pokemon. Blissey needs Calm Mind to\ndeal any sort of reasonable damage to any Pokemon in the metagame, and\ngiving devastating physical attackers like Heracross and Tyranitar a\nchance to safely switch in can be devastating. Finally, Blissey's\npitiful Defense stat ensures that nearly all physical attackers in OU\nwill 2HKO her. However, despite lacking an offensive presence and a\nhaving a terrible Defense stat, Blissey stands tall and fat as one of\nthe best Pokemon in OU and not considering using her is silliness.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>As far as other options go, Blissey has a lot in the literal sense as\nher movepool is nearly as large as its HP stat. However, it's usually\nbetter to stick with the moves listed earlier. Counter is probably the\nbest option that hasn't been listed previously as Blissey can tank most\nphysical attacks that aren't super effective or boosted by a Choice Band\nand retaliate with Counter, likely OHKOing the opponent's Pokemon. Sing\nis a possibility over Toxic or Thunder Wave but its accuracy is\nhorrendous. Additionally, Sing doesn't deter Pokemon such as Calm Mind\nCelebi and Jirachi from switching out as they can take Seismic Toss and\nIce Beam (Celebi needs a Calm Mind though), wait until they wake up,\nrecover off any HP lost with Recover or Wish, and continue setting up\nuntil you hit another Sing. The rest of Blissey's movepool contains\nmoves that could've been good for other Pokemon such as Brick Break and\nFocus Punch but you really should be sticking with the sets listed or\nthe previously mentioned opponents.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>One of Blissey's largest problems is her terrible Defense stat; thus,\nnearly all physical attackers make for great Blissey checks. Snorlax is\nBlissey's best counter; it possesses an excellent HP stat, great Attack\nstat, and high enough Special Defense stat, so it can not only take\nanything Blissey wants to throw at it but it can also threaten her out\nwith a physical attack. Additionally, both of Snorlax's abilities are\nvery good versus Blissey; Immunity stops more defensive Blissey variants\nfrom poisoning Snorlax on the switch, while Thick Fat lets Snorlax take\non the Calm Mind set with greater ease. Other than Snorlax, the best\noverall Blissey switch-in, most physical attackers that defeat Blissey\nwith ease. Choice Band Salamence with Brick Break, Dragon Dance\nTyranitar, Taunt Dragon Dance Gyarados, Heracross, Metagross, and many\nother physical attackers do a great job of beating Blissey, under the\nright circumstances. Remember that depending on Calm Mind Blissey's\nmoves, it can deal a great amount of damage to any of the physical\nattackers on the switch in; for example, Gyarados is OHKOed by\nThunderbolt. Thus, it's usually a good idea to scout out your opponent's\nBlissey set before switching in your powerful physical attackers.</p>\n<p>Despite being the undisputed best specially defensive Pokemon in the\ntier, maybe even the game, there are still certain special attackers\nthat Blissey can lose to. With the aid of Spikes, Metal Sound Zapdos and\nCalm Mind + Roar Suicune can wither away at Blissey's HP and sweep when\nthe chance is right. Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune easily defeats any\nBlissey set lacking Calm Mind, as Seismic Toss fails to break Suicune's\nSubstitute. Suicune can then proceed to block status with Substitute,\nset up Calm Minds, and run through your opponent's team. Wish + Calm\nMind Jirachi can set up all over Blissey's lacking Calm Mind as it is\nimmune to Toxic. Calm Mind + Leech Seed Celebi can beat Blissey without\nToxic or Calm Mind and has the potential to beat Calm Mind Blissey as\nLeech Seed deters Blissey from staying in for too long. Metal Sound\nZapdos, and to a lesser extent Magneton, can defeat Blissey by lowering\nher Special Defense and bombarding the pink blob with Thunderbolt.</p>\n",

Zapdos\nand Moltres are two other Pokemon that resist Metagross's two most\npowerful attacks, but watch out for Rock Slide. Similarly, Charizard is\na threat to Metagross that lack Rock Slide as it might launch a Belly\nDrum and go for the sweep.

Furthermore, even if\nMetagross has Earthquake, there are scenarios in which Magneton can win.\nFor example, if Magneton outspeeds Metagross and Metagross is at 40%\nhealth or below, Magneton should be able to KO Metagross with\nThunderbolt before Metagross can use Earthquake.

However, this set is setup\nfodder for Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax, and is also unable to recover\nefficiently.</p>\n<p>Toxic is an interesting option to use over Confuse Ray on the parafusion\nset; it can even be considered over Surf on the RestTalk set, but is not\nrecommended as it allows Dugtrio a free switch. Nonetheless, it can wear\ndown Lanturn's counters, such as Swampert. Hydro Pump is an alternative\nSTAB option, but its low PP is an issue in longer games, and it does not\ngive enough extra power over Surf to merit use. Thunder is a viable\noption on the RestTalk set if you want Lanturn to be able to spread\nstatus, but its low accuracy is a major turn-off. Even though Lanturn is\nbulky enough to afford the occasional miss, it could miss a crucial KO\non a threat such as Explosion Cloyster.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Celebi is the best Lanturn counter in the game as it resists both\nLanturn's STAB moves, does not fear paralysis, and is able to use Leech\nSeed to chip away Lanturn's HP. Celebi can also set up Calm Mind boosts\non Lanturn with impunity. Swampert is immune to Electric-type attacks,\ntakes little from Surf, and can do heavy damage with Earthquake or set\nup with Curse; it needs to watch out for Toxic, however. Snorlax has an\nawesome Special Defense stat, can take any hit that Lanturn dishes out,\nand sets up Curse on it fearlessly. Blissey stops Lanturn cold, but\ncan't really hurt it back. It will always win a stall war one-on-one,\nhowever. Metagross can take anything Lanturn throws at it and can OHKO\nit with Earthquake.</p>\n<p>Venusaur resists both of Lanturn's STAB moves and can wear it down with\nLeech Seed or hit it hard with Razor Leaf. It can even set up with\nSwords Dance on it. However, Venusaur needs to avoid paralysis and Ice\nBeam. Exeggutor is in the same boat as Venusaur, but it also needs to\nwatch out for paralysis and Ice Beam if attempting to sweep.</p>\n<p>Finally, although it can't switch in on Surf or Ice Beam, Dugtrio can\ntrap and revenge kill Lanturn.</p>\n",

Shadow Ball is another good option for the third slot to complete Swalot's neutral coverage with Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground, destroy Haunter, and land a good hit on Chimecho without having to resort to Explosion.

Chimecho and Haunter are probably the safest switches into Swalot, though the former needs to be really careful of Explosion and Swalot's specially defensive set may just be luring it in for that exact reason.

Counter is a major move that sets Swalot apart from other defensive Pokemon like Chimecho and Sableye, giving it a tool to take a powerful physical attack and eliminate the attacker in one turn.</p>\n<p>Toxic is the best option in the third slot to allow Swalot to spread damage around defensive teams and force Chimecho to switch out or use Heal Bell or Rest. Yawn can be used to force switches, which works extra well with Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Thunder Punch is another option for this slot to give Swalot amazing neutral coverage and let it hit the Water-types that can otherwise tank Ice Beam super effectively.

Physical attacks such as Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground can be used over Ice Beam and Thunder Punch, but most of the physical threats that Swalot can counter have lower Special Defense (the major exception being Hitmonchan). Running a physical move also allows Swalot to run a neutral Speed nature, which can sometimes come in handy to get the Explosion off against a defensive Pokemon like Kecleon before getting hit.</p>\n<p>Chimecho is probably the best immediate safe switch-in to Swalot, as it destroys Swalot with its STAB Psychic, but it really needs to be wary of Explosion. Haunter with Psychic is probably a better switch-in to Swalot for this reason alone, though it takes far more damage from Ice Beam than Chimecho does.

Amazing mixed bulk, immunity to Toxic, and great longevity provided by RestTalk make this set extremely hard to take out, especially for balanced defensive teams. Ice Beam is Swalot's best general attacking move, as it sports good power and has no immunities, although Sludge Bomb can be used instead, as it has a good poison chance and hits slightly harder on neutral targets, in particular Hitmonchan, thanks to STAB, though at the cost of Swalot being completely walled by Steel-types if not also running Hidden Power Ground.</p>\n<p>Toxic pairs best with Ice Beam to spread as much residual damage as possible and allows Swalot to outstall certain threats like Sableye and Flareon, which cannot do much in return thanks to Swalot's immunity to Toxic. Sludge Bomb + Toxic may be kind of redundant and leaves Swalot completely exposed to Steel-types and Rock-types with Substitute, meaning Hidden Power Ground is the better move to run when using Sludge Bomb. Yawn is a viable third option for the second slot, but it doesn't really allow Swalot to outstall other Pokemon except for the chance to put Chimecho or Lickitung with Heal Bell to sleep.</p>\n<p>The EV spread and nature let Swalot avoid being 3HKOed by Timid Plusle's Thunderbolt and any of Choice Band Hitmonchan's attacks aside from Earthquake. There are a lot of moves that can be used in the first and second slots not mentioned above, and they depend largely on what your team needs. Counter is the most prominent and can ensure that Choice Band attackers think twice before trying to take out Swalot.</p>\n<p>Spikes are a near must with this set, meaning Roselia and Glalie are good teammates to consider. Chimecho is particularly dangerous for this set, as it can set up Calm Mind or use Heal Bell in front of Swalot without it being able to do much in return. Haunter also doesn't care for much of anything Swalot does with this set. Lickitung, Sableye, or an offensive check like Murkrow or Kecleon is an almost required teammate due to this fact. Steel-, Ground-, and Rock-types have an easier time with this set as well, as they don't need to really watch out for Counter, Explosion, or Hidden Power Ground in most cases. Defensive teammates like Pelipper and Relicanth or offensive checks like Hitmonchan are therefore needed to ensure that Swalot isn't just complete setup bait for these Pokemon.</p>\n"

Even though Swalot's somewhat outclassed, its resistance to Fighting and relatively few weaknesses across the board make it a decent choice for balanced defensive teams. By being a great check to Hitmonchan, disrupting stall tactics by the likes of Sableye and Roselia, and packing an atom bomb in Explosion, Swalot performs amicably in the tier and has a place on balanced teams that need to condense roles into a couple of Pokemon.</p>\n",

A specially attacking tank set is definitely viable, as Swalot has a decent base 73 Special Attack and a very nice special movepool with Ice Beam, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Hidden Power Grass; the surprise moves Counter and Explosion can still make an appearance here too. A Choice Band set can also be done, as a Choice Band-boosted Explosion is absolutely ridiculous, and STAB Sludge Bomb is going to leave a huge mark in targets like Chimecho.</p>\n<p>As for individual moves, Pain Split is Swalot's best chance at reliable recovery outside of Rest, but it's pretty hard to use considering Swalot's massive HP stat. Swalot gets both Sunny Day and Rain Dance; it can use either to good effect and get a weather sweeper in for free with Explosion. Sing can be used to put a target to sleep, but its accuracy sucks and Yawn is about as effective overall. A combination of Acid Armor and Amnesia can make Swalot nigh-impenetrable save for a critical hit, but they do nothing to prevent the opponent from setting up on Swalot as usual.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The best general switch-ins to Swalot are Chimecho and Haunter, the latter being probably better since it is immune to Explosion and 4x resists Sludge Bomb. Sableye is another great switch-in for the same reasons and can set up Calm Mind in front of Swalot, though it will need to watch out for Toxic. Otherwise, Steel-types like Mawile and Metang are probably the safest switch-ins to Swalot, as they resist Ice Beam and Explosion and are immune to Toxic. In general, anything with Earthquake like Piloswine, Graveler, Relicanth, or Whiscash will be effective against Swalot, though they must be prepared for Counter. In the same vein, Diglett can trap and nail Swalot with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, coming close to OHKOing the specially defensive set, but it will be only doing 68% at most to the physically defensive set. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Pupitar and Bulk Up Vigoroth definitely give Swalot some problems as well. Finally, immediately strong special or physical attackers like Rain Dance Huntail, Choice Band Kingler, and Abra will be able to plow through Swalot without many issues.</p>\n",

However, the Choice Band set can be defeated\nwith superior prediction, and both boosting sets are vulnerable to\nsimply being outpaced and revenge killed by Pokemon that can hit it\nadequately hard or super effectively, such as Heracross and Medicham.\nChoice Band Metagross is also an excellent counter because it will\nalways OHKO in sandstorm with Meteor Mash and resists Return, Ursaring's\nmain STAB option. Ursaring also needs to avoid Choice Band Salamence\nbecause of its Intimidate ability and the possible threat of Brick\nBreak.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Haunter fits best on offensive teams, and thanks to its three immunities, it's relatively easy to get it onto the battlefield, get behind a Substitute, and start blasting away at the opposition with the correct move. Thunderbolt + Hidden Power Fire gets great neutral and super effective coverage in the tier and destroys the Pokemon that Haunter likes to switch into. Hidden Power Ice offers more complete neutral coverage and perfect Speed IVs but misses out on super effective hits on Mawile, Metang, Glalie, Piloswine, and Shedinja. The last slot helps add on super effective coverage, depending on the targets that your team needs eliminated. Psychic is probably the more prudent option, as it allows Haunter to be a better answer to Hitmonchan, as well as Arbok, Swalot, and Seviper. Giga Drain is a good alternative and pairs very well with Hidden Power Fire to let Haunter remove Pupitar, Whiscash, and Graveler from play.</p>\n<p>Timid is chosen as the nature so that Haunter is as fast as possible, which is extra important considering Haunter is tied for the second fastest Pokemon in the tier. Modest is strictly not an option, as Haunter then fails to outspeed base 90s, as well as losing out on the tie with other Haunter and Plusle. Due to Haunter's super low base HP stat, Shell Bell is actually an option over Leftovers, as Haunter can actually gain a decent amount of HP back on the targets that Haunter can OHKO or 2HKO.</p>\n<p>Haunter has a great movepool, so its options are definitely not limited to the ones listed above. The most prominent alternative is Hidden Power Dark, as Haunter normally lures in Chimecho pretty well and taking it out can open the door for a sweeper like Huntail. Hidden Power Water is a great move to deal a huge hit to Flareon which otherwise comfortably tanks Haunter's other moves. Explosion is an option in the last slot to deal huge damage to the specially defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Haunter, particularly Flareon and Kecleon. In the same vein, Destiny Bond is a fantastic option thanks to Haunter's Speed to ensure a KO against a Pokemon of your choosing, and it is made even better thanks to Haunter's immunity to Toxic and the priority available in NU. Torment can allow Haunter to royally screw over Choice attackers but is otherwise kind of hard to use due to Haunter's utter frailty making it susceptible to even most Pokemon's less-preferred move to hit it with. Finally, Psych Up can prevent Sableye and Chimecho from using Haunter as Calm Mind setup bait and turn the tables on them.</p>\n<p>Haunter fits best on offensive teams where it can use its immunities to switch in and continually pressure the opponent. Spikes support will help in this endeavor and Glalie makes a great partner, as Haunter can patch up the weakness to Hitmonchan as long as Haunter avoids Hidden Power Ghost. There are a few Pokemon that can switch into this set without much fear, in particular Normal-type special walls like Kecleon, Lickitung, and Wigglytuff, as Haunter has nothing that can threaten them apart from the rare Explosion or Toxic. Hitmonchan thus makes a good offensive partner, as it can blow right through these walls as well as some other special walls that threaten Haunter like Flareon and Bellossom. Other good partners are those that can beat Calm Mind Chimecho and Sableye as they will otherwise use Haunter as setup bait. Strong attackers like Murkrow and Raticate can help in this regard, as well as other special attackers that don't fear these two like Flareon and Huntail.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>This set is designed to allow Haunter to more efficiently target and cripple certain Pokemon that Haunter otherwise has a difficult time beating one-on-one. This includes non-Choice Band Hitmonchan that will be able to otherwise take Haunter out with Hidden Power Ghost before Haunter can remove it with Psychic. A burned or sleeping Hitmonchan is much easier for Haunter's team to handle, letting Pokemon like Chimecho completely wall it. A statused Kecleon or Lickitung is also much easier for a special attacking teammate like Huntail to break through. Thunderbolt + Hidden Power Ice is the best available two-move coverage that Haunter has and Haunter can always cripple the Pokemon that give it the most trouble. However, Hidden Power Fire is a decent option still as it gains a few prominent super effective hits in the tier and Haunter is able to status the Pokemon that it misses out on like Graveler and Whiscash. Just beware of Pupitar if using Hidden Power Fire, as it can shrug off Will-O-Wisp thanks to Shed Skin.</p>\n<p>The EVs are designed so that Haunter will always survive a Hidden Power Ghost from a burned Choice Band Hitmonchan, with Speed maximized to ensure that Haunter still ties with other Haunter and Plusle. Hidden Power Water is a great option in the last slot on this set as well, as it removes Flareon and prevents other Fire-types from being able to effectively answer Haunter as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Toxic is an option in the status slot as well, as it is Haunter's most effective option to cripple the specially defensive Pokemon that counter Haunter, in particular Chimecho and Sableye that will also use Haunter as setup bait.</p>\n<p>This set fits best on balanced teams that need as many Pokemon on the opposing team crippled to make room for a setup sweeper like Dragon Dance Pupitar and Swords Dance Kingler to set up effectively. If not using Hidden Power Water, Flareon is a major blockade to the success of this set, making Water-types like Pelipper and Wailord good teammates. Diglett can also make a good partner with this set, as it can help in removing specific enemy threats like Flareon and allow a teammate to sweep, such as Sunny Day Bellossom.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Haunter has a major niche in the NU tier as one of only three Ghost-types, and the most offensive one of the three by far. With three immunities, all of which are typically Choice-locked moves in NU, getting Haunter onto the battlefield is actually far easier than its frailty would suggest. While Haunter sports no usable STAB moves due to its low Attack (if not using a Choice Band, anyway), its super high base 115 Special Attack, great base 95 Speed, and awesome movepool more than make up for it. As long as you keep in mind just how frail Haunter is it'll always pull its weight in a match, and it is a Pokemon to always keep on your radar when teambuilding.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Haunter's movepool is pretty expansive, and honestly, most other move options can be easily fit anywhere on the sets above. One thing not explicitly mentioned so far is using Haunter's STAB moves on its sets, and this is due to Haunter's pitifully low Attack. However, with a Choice Band and max Attack, Haunter can at least hit decently hard, and due to the stat spreads in NU, most of the specially defensive Pokemon that are likely to switch into Haunter are going to take massive damage from any Choice Band-boosted attacks. In addition, a Choice Band-boosted Explosion is nothing to scoff at, making a set like this a great lure for a special attacking partner like Plusle or Huntail to sweep late-game.</p>\n<p>As for other move options, Curse can be used to severely cripple the likes of Flareon, but unfortunately it is just canceled out by the opponent switching out immediately, and Haunter is simply just not bulky enough to make use of Mean Look. Haze is great to ensure Calm Mind Chimecho cannot set up on Haunter, but again Haunter's bulk kind of lets it down. Haunter can easily support weather sweepers with Rain Dance and Sunny Day and get off the field quickly with Explosion. Skill Swap is a funny move to really mess with something like Flareon, but it is pretty situational on the whole. Grudge can be used in place of Destiny Bond on any set, but a fellow KO is just more desired on Haunter. Finally, Taunt can be used to ensure Lickitung can't use Haunter to heal up and makes it much easier to remove throughout the match.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Because Haunter can essentially have an answer to everything, nothing in the tier outright fully counters Haunter. That said, specially defensive Wish Flareon fears very little from Haunter outside of the rare Explosion or Hidden Power Water and can easily toast Haunter with Fire Blast or Flamethrower. RestTalk Kecleon fears nothing apart from Explosion from Haunter and can easily eliminate it with Shadow Ball. Specially defensive Chimecho easily tanks everything Haunter can throw at it apart from Hidden Power Dark and OHKO back with STAB Psychic. Swalot can comfortably tank a Psychic from Haunter and wall it to kingdom come if it lacks Psychic. If Haunter lacks Giga Drain, Whiscash is an almost complete stop to Haunter and can blast it with Surf in return. Finally, most Pokemon in the tier with access to Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ghost can tank at least one attack from Haunter and OHKO it back.</p>\n",

Snatch can grab Soft-Boiled\nfrom Blissey and Calm Mind from other Pokemon, so it's an OK move.\nMewtwo has better choices though.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>At least 330 Speed for the Uber metagame, although Mewtwo can hit Speeds much higher if you want, and 351 is advised for outrunning Latias, Latios, and Lugia. You'll want a good amount of Special Attack and Modest; however, if you use Substitute, put in 404 HP first. Attacking Mewtwo can put less in Special Attack and more in Attack.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Honestly, it depends on the set your opponent is running. There is no\ncounter that will work 100% of the time against Mewtwo. Deoxys-D is a\nsafe bet, Blissey might have troubles. Both of those are good at\ndiscovering Mewtwo's moveset without instantly dying, unlike Pokemon\nlike Metagross, who can't risk a fire move. Once you know Mewtwo's set,\nit's not nearly as dangerous (but still very deadly). Deoxys-A can\nswitch into any non-attacking move but Substitute (even Psychic from a\nnon-Modest Mewtwo OHKOs) and OHKO with Shadow Ball, but it needs a\nChoice Band to do it. It can survive an unboosted Brick Break, but that\nis extremely rarely used. Choice Band Ho-Oh survives all of Mewtwo's\nattacks except maybe Self-Destruct, and can hit it hard with Choice Band\nShadow Ball (potentially an OHKO), while Mewtwo's Thunderbolt is\ngenerally a 3HKO. At the very least, it can be used to scout out\nMewtwo's set.</p>\n",

It is already so delicate that I felt it was much more important to make sure it could both withstand and dish out attacks. My EVs were pretty much 252 Attacking Stat/252 Defensive Stat/4 Speed. Nature could be either +Attack or +Defense. I tried to compensate for its lack of defenses by concentrating on only one defensive stat and using it only against Pokemon primarily of that alignment. Although it melts against attacks it isn't designed to take, this setup actually gives it decent durability. It is more vulnerable, but it is probably more effective overall. Castform really is not designed to be easy to play. If you really wanted to use mixed defenses go ahead, but I don't think it would be effective at all. I would like to see how Castform does in the UU metagame, however, which I sadly haven't played at all.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Tyranitar counters almost any Castform, except perhaps ones with HP\nFighting. Almost anything can potentially counter Castform. However,\nCastform is pretty versatile (considering that is the whole idea of him\neven having Forecast and Weather Ball) and you have a decent shot at\nsurprising your opponent and maybe even scoring a kill. I don't think\nmost people are aware of the attack options available to Castform (as\nfar as types go). However, you probably aren't going to hurt anyone\nwho's on top of their game (since they are evil and will just switch a\nwall in), but Castform is pretty fun to use regardless.</p>\n",

If your style is more conservative, Return is a decent STAB alternative to Double-Edge; however, the power drop is noticeable against defensive threats like physically defensive Lickitung, where Return will fail to 2HKO but Double-Edge has a 30% chance of doing so even without Spikes support (it is guaranteed with one layer of Spikes). Aerial Ace completely wrecks Hitmonchan and works well with Hidden Power Ground, which takes out the Rock- and Steel-types likely to switch into Pidgeot. Please note that Aerial Ace should only be used in situations where the recoil from using Double-Edge would be undesirable, as Aerial Ace hits at about half the strength of Double-Edge on neutral targets.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Hidden Power Flying can be used over Aerial Ace, as it hits slightly harder and has a chance to OHKO defensive Bellossom after Spikes. However, if Hidden Power Flying is chosen, Steel Wing must be used in the third slot in order to provide coverage against Rock-types. This combination of moves should only be chosen if switching into Steel- and Rock-types is not an issue for Pidgeot's team. The last moveslot goes to Quick Attack, which is surprisingly strong when backed by STAB and Choice Band. It's useful for picking off weakened Plusle and can be used as a last resort against weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail.</p>\n<p>Jolly is the nature of choice to ensure Pidgeot can Speed tie against other Pidgeot and Murkrow. Dropping the Speed down by going with Adamant gives Pidgeot quite a bit more power, but being slower than other Pidgeot and Murkrow, not to mention getting outsped by base 90 Speed Pokemon, is just terrible.</p>\n<p>Hidden Power Grass can be used on this set to easily eliminate Graveler, Whiscash, and Relicanth; however, Hidden Power Ground is usually better for retaining the super effective hit on Magcargo and Mawile, among other threats. Spikes support is incredible when used with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly defensive threats like Lickitung and Swalot. What's more, nearly every defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Pidgeot is grounded, with Pelipper being about the only exception. Because of this, Roselia and Glalie are nearly necessary teammates to pair with Pidgeot.</p>\n<p>Pidgeot is a great check to the Grass-types of the tier, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it. Loading on the Choice Band users is a good strategy when using Pidgeot, as very few teams can withstand that kind of onslaught, particularly if Pidgeot is used with its partner in crime, Murkrow, as well as other Normal-types like Vigoroth and Raticate. Finally, Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Pidgeot, so something that can absorb Electric-type attacks is needed. Here again, Roselia is a good teammate, as are Ground-types like Whiscash, Graveler, and Piloswine.</p>\n"

Even without any HP investment, Pidgeot's Substitute is never broken by defensive Tangela's Hidden Power Grass, which is something Murkrow can't accomplish even with maximum HP investment. Substitute is used to ease prediction, protect Pidgeot from status, and prevent revenge killers like Plusle and Haunter from accomplishing their mission. The ability to switch moves is the major reason why you would choose this set over Choice Band, as there are a number of Pokemon that can switch into any one of Pidgeot's moves, but few that are safe from them all.</p>\n<p>Return is used over Double-Edge to avoid recoil and make the most of Leftovers, Pidgeot's higher bulk, and its ability to stick around in a battle longer than Murkrow. Hidden Power Ground is a good move to ensure that Steel- and Rock-types can't just switch in and dominate Pidgeot, but Quick Attack is also a great move to ward off Plusle and other faster attackers like Raticate from just switching in willy-nilly. Finally, Aerial Ace is used as a secondary STAB attack, but it's very weak when not super effective. Therefore, Toxic is a good replacement; it's probably Pidgeot's best move for very bulky walls like Relicanth, and it's a good way to stall out dangerous threats like Huntail and Vigoroth.</p>\n<p>A Jolly nature is needed to Speed tie with other Pidgeot and Murkrow and outrun Venomoth. However, Adamant is an option on this set thanks to Substitute protecting Pidgeot from being revenge killed, and it beefs up the power behind its STAB Return. Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes many Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly less defensive Steel-types like Mawile. Thanks to the lack of Choice Band, Spikes punishes common switch-ins even more, as Pidgeot can use Return as a drawback-free move and then follow up with a more appropriate attack.</p>\n<p>Pidgeot is a great check to Grass-types, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it, particularly more immediately offensive Pokemon like Graveler and Seadra. Murkrow is another good offensive teammate to pair with this particular Pidgeot set, as Pidgeot can very effectively lure in targets like Mawile and Plusle and eliminate them with Hidden Power Ground from behind a Substitute, opening up an easy sweep for Murkrow later in the game.</p>\n"

On the downside, Pidgeot hits slightly weaker than Murkrow with its coverage attacks.

Hidden Power Ghost ensures that Kingler isn't completely walled by Ghost-types, particularly Haunter and Shedinja, though Hidden Power Ground can be chosen instead, as it gets the same hit on Sableye while giving Kingler a much better tool for Swalot, Mawile, and Relicanth than Kingler's other moves.</p>\n<p>Kingler's viable physical movepool stops there, though there are other Hidden Power types worth considering. Hidden Power Rock has pretty good coverage with Double-Edge and rips apart Dewgong, Pelipper, and Golbat. Hidden Power Bug gives Kingler a reliable hit on Tangela and is a stronger option for Bellossom and Chimecho.</p>\n<p>The last two slots have to go to special moves in order to fill Kingler's moveset. As it happens, Surf isn't an absolutely terrible move to get locked into. Kingler's Special Attack is just high enough to make it the better option for taking out a few Rock-types, particularly Graveler, as well as Magcargo, Lairon, Sudowoodo, and Pupitar if not running Hidden Power Ground. Blizzard is Kingler's best attack for Tangela, but it doesn't have much use outside of that. The last slot can also go to Flail, but it's probably more situational than Blizzard is considering how difficult it is to use it effectively.</p>\n<p>A Naughty nature is used so as to not lower the power of Surf and Blizzard while giving Kingler as much power behind its physical attacks as possible. A Naive nature can be used to outrun positive-natured base 65 Speed Pokemon, particularly maximum Speed Flareon and Adamant Hitmonchan, the latter of which would make it worth it, though maximum Speed base 65 Speed Pokemon are rare. Kingler does get access to Mud Shot and Rock Tomb as alternative physical move options, which can allow Kingler to use a different Hidden Power type like Ghost more comfortably, but they're so weak that it really isn't worth getting locked into either one of them in the long run.</p>\n<p>Choice Band Kingler should be used primarily as a wallbreaker for another physical attacker to sweep late-game, or as part of a physical onslaught core with the goal of overwhelming the opposing team with multiple Choice Band attackers. Kingler makes for a good fit for the latter with its access to Surf and Blizzard, which can be used to remove a wall that resists Normal, such as Graveler, which would otherwise be pesky for other typical members of the team, like Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Raticate, to break through.</p>\n<p>Kingler is easily revenge killed by fast special attackers like Plusle and Haunter, so packing a special wall or tank is highly recommended when using Kingler, with Flareon and Sableye among the best choices for teammates. Lickitung and Kecleon are also solid choices, with Kecleon also making for a good choice for physical onslaught teams if using a Choice Band set. Having a teammate to take on defensive Tangela and Bellossom is also recommended, as they can tank an attack or two from Kingler and OHKO it in return with their Grass-type STAB moves. Murkrow stands out as a great offensive partner to switch into them, while Flareon is a great defensive choice.</p>\n"

Here are some calculations to highlight the sheer power of Kingler's Flail against a selection of common Pokemon in the tier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Hitmonchan: 120.2 - 141.7%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Bellossom: 93.8 - 110.6%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Huntail: 91.2 - 107.5%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Pidgeot: 98.3 - 115.9%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/0 Flareon: 108.3 - 127.5%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Vigoroth: 95.3 - 112.2%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 56.5 - 66.7%</li>\n<li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 113 - 133.2%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 53.9 - 63.5%</li>\n<li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 107.5 - 126.5%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 48 - 56.6%</li>\n<li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 95.7 - 112.8%</li>\n<li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 31.5 - 37.1%</li>\n<li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 62.8 - 74%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hidden Power Ghost has the best two-move coverage with Flail, ensuring that Haunter and Shedinja don't just completely wall Kingler. However, Hidden Power Ground is an option, as it gives Kingler a move to 2HKO maximum Defense Mawile without a Swords Dance boost, and OHKO it with a boost. Hidden Power Ground is also Kingler's best hope against defensive Relicanth, but it still manages to 2HKO maximum Defense Relicanth at +2. If you don't think that Kingler will be able to find the time to boost with Swords Dance, Surf is a decent option in its place, as it is Kingler's best option for Graveler, Pupitar, Magcargo, and Sudowoodo, OHKOing the former three and cleanly 2HKOing 252 HP versions of the latter.</p>\n<p>Kingler makes for an amazing late-game sweeper with this set if you can bait something like Plusle or Haunter into attacking Kingler, use Endure as they use Thunderbolt, obtain the Salac Berry's Speed boost and a full-powered Flail, and proceed to just mangle everything left on the opponent's team. Be wary of both of these Pokemon and other similar frail attackers like them using Substitute before attacking Kingler. If you aren't confident in your baiting skills, Substitute is a much safer option to bring Kingler down to 1 HP to begin the sweep; just be sure to keep Spikes off the field so that it will work correctly.</p>\n<p>There really aren't any other options to consider in regards to EVs or nature; however, a positive Speed nature is worth considering in order to allow Kingler to outpace Adamant Hitmonchan before attempting to boost. Considering Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to priority in the tier, removing it when possible is desirable when using this set. That said, without a positive Attack nature, many of the KOs and 2HKOs listed above, and many more not listed, are just missed out on.</p>\n<p>If using Substitute, Kingler should have 8 HP EVs to try make it easier to bring it down to low health manually; however, the prevalence of Spikes in the tier makes it incredibly hard to bring Kingler down to 1 HP correctly. Substitute does come with the benefit of blocking status and protecting Kingler from priority if done correctly, but it also requires Kingler to get in on a foe it outspeeds, which is not always possible. Both Endure and Substitute have a major risk factor attached to them, but Endure is generally the better choice for the most situations in this tier.</p>\n<p>This set can only 2HKO most defensive threats without a Swords Dance boost, and even many offensive Pokemon with some HP investment avoid the OHKO, increasing the importance of making this set a late-game sweeper once most Pokemon on the opposing side have been weakened, and preferably with a layer or two of Spikes set up to push a few of those aforementioned calculations into guaranteed KOs. Tangela, Rock-types, and Steel-types are particularly important to remove or weaken before bringing out Kingler and attempting a sweep. Diglett is a good Pokemon to consider to use with Kingler to remove, or at least heavily weaken, the latter two obstacles. Murkrow and Flareon are both good options to consider to take on Tangela and defensive Bellossom.</p>\n"

Body Slam is the main attack due to its paralysis chance, and with the given EVs, it'll almost always 2HKO 4/0 Hitmonchan and Pidgeot. Knock Off is actually surprisingly good in the NU tier due to the prevalence of Spikes, and without their Leftovers, defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Sableye become much more exposed to various 2HKOs they otherwise just barely avoid. Toxic conflicts with Body Slam a bit, but it is a great tool when combined with Knock Off to quickly wear out the likes of Sableye and other defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Kingler, like non-RestTalk Relicanth and Tangela. The last slot is largely filler, but Surf prevents Rock-types like Graveler and Pupitar from switching freely into this set, even when Kingler's using an Adamant nature. Hidden Power Ground is a good alternative if a weak Surf is undesirable, and it is Kingler's best weapon against Mawile.</p>\n<p>Maximum HP investment increases Kingler's overall bulk substantially due to its low base HP stat. 72 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Huntail before it sets up rain, and the remaining EVs are placed into Attack to beef up Body Slam to allow Kingler to better threaten targets like Chimecho, Kecleon, and Hitmonchan. No Defense or Special Defense EVs are needed, as the investment in HP increases Kingler's bulk enough, and further defensive investment leaves Kingler outclassed by Wailord and Whiscash.</p>\n<p>A main goal of this set is to spread paralysis with Body Slam and generally weaken the opponent's team to allow another teammate to come in later in the match and clean up. This means that slower, but stronger sweepers that love having the opposing team paralyzed make for the best teammates, which include special Flareon, Choice Band Piloswine, and Swords Dance Tropius.</p>\n<p>Plusle and Haunter easily KO this set with Thunderbolt, and Haunter is usually immune to three out of the four attacks, making special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung particularly good teammates to use with this set. Kecleon is also a good check to offensive Huntail, which can otherwise set up on Kingler and KO it quite easily, although it faces the risk of getting paralyzed by Body Slam. Most Grass-types dislike getting paralyzed or poisoned by this set, but they will OHKO Kingler quite easily, making Flareon and Murkrow good teammates to use with Kingler too. Finally, Mawile makes for a particularly good defensive partner to this set, and together with a special wall like Kecleon, it can form a solid defensive core to take on a majority of the tier quite effectively.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Kingler possesses an insane base 130 Attack stat, but like many Pokemon in NU, it can't make use of it with its STAB moves. That said, with access to Double-Edge and a Speed stat that puts it above all of the common defensive Pokemon in the tier to back up its massive Attack, Kingler is still a very dangerous Choice Band attacker and late-game sweeper to look out for. It also has a nice base 115 Defense stat, meaning it doesn't simply fall over to the few priority attacks that exist in the metagame and can pull off an effective defensive set as well. While Kingler seems scary at first glance, its shallow movepool, terrible Special Defense, middling Speed, and poor coverage all attribute to its downfall, and it is ultimately effectively walled by most of the popular walls available in the tier if played around correctly.</p>\n",

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A straight Swords Dance sweeper is a doable take on Kingler, but the immediate power of Choice Band is typically more appealing, and the fact that Kingler isn't really going to be using much other than Double-Edge means it won't necessarily appreciate the ability to switch moves with a Swords Dance set. Apart from that, there's really not much else to do with Kingler; its movepool is so shallow that there is nothing else to mention, except that Rock Tomb and Mud Shot are &quot;usable&quot; on all the above sets but probably not worth it.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Switching into Kingler is a daunting task, but Pokemon that resist Normal are a good place to start. Sableye is probably the safest answer to all Kingler variants, as it's immune to Double-Edge and Flail and takes a pittance from Kingler's coverage moves; the only things it has to really worry about are a Swords Dance-boosted Kingler and Toxic from the defensive set. Defensive Relicanth and other Rock- and Steel-types are the next best answers to Kingler, although a multitude of the latter two need to be wary of Hidden Power Ground and Surf. Defensive Tangela is a pretty surefire check to any Kingler set; it just needs to watch out for Blizzard and the rare Hidden Power Bug.</p>\n<p>Kingler isn't exactly bulky, so taking it out offensively and revenge killing it is a pretty easy task if you lack a good defensive answer to it. Plusle and Haunter easily OHKO any Kingler set with Thunderbolt. Offensive Grass- and Water-types will also easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass. The main thing to keep in mind when checking Kingler offensively is to not be baited into activating its Salac Berry and then staring down the barrel of a full-powered Flail sweep.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>As opposed to being an offensive threat itself, this set aims to act as\na solid utility counter and defensive pivot; it is excellent at forcing\nswitches. Earthquake is a strong STAB move that threatens many Pokemon\nthat Swampert counters, such as Metagross and Jirachi. Ice Beam provides\nexcellent coverage and, in conjunction with Earthquake, enables Swampert\nto hit everything in OU for neutral damage. Ice Beam takes a decent\nchunk out of any Celebi switching in and forces it to Recover, which in\nturn allows a teammate to switch in without fear of Leech Seed or\nPsychic. Hydro Pump is the primary option in the third moveslot because\nit takes a good 50% out of standard Skarmory, stopping Skarmory from\nsetting up on Swampert; it also deals good damage to Gengar. Surf is\nworth considering due to its higher accuracy. Toxic is an excellent move\non Swampert as many of its counters, such as Gyarados, Vaporeon,\nMilotic, and Ludicolo, have difficulty with poison; it also allows\nSwampert to beat other Swampert with ease. However, Toxic only works\nwell in conjunction with Protect, and is best used on stall teams. Curse\nis another option that works with Protect, allowing you to slowly regain\nhealth and scout for Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Swampert to beat\nBlissey one-on-one, while also threatening unprepared teams. Protect is\nthe primary fourth option as it lets Swampert scout its switch-ins for\ndeadly attacks such as Hidden Power Grass or Explosion. The extra turn\nof recovery that Protect provides is also extremely useful and helps\nSwampert Toxic stall its opponents. Roar is an alternative because\nSwampert is excellent at forcing switches; it can consistently rack up\nSpikes damage by using Roar on a predicted switch.</p>\n<p>With the given EV spread, Swampert reaches 404 HP, which enables it to\nswitch into three layers of Spikes four times or survive five Seismic\nTosses thanks to Leftovers. The Special Attack EVs boost Ice Beam's\ndamage output enough to force Celebi to Recover and give up momentum. It\nhas enough Special Attack to OHKO Flygon and Dragon Dance Tyranitar with\nIce Beam and Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump, respectively. Either Water-type\nSTAB will 3HKO max HP Skarmory. A Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump also OHKOes\nminimum HP Gengar on average after sand damage.</p>\n<p>Swampert's best partner is probably Skarmory. The pair has excellent\ntype synergy and together they can check numerous threats, such as\nTyranitar, Metagross, Heracross, and Salamence. Thanks to its ability to\nforce so many switches, Swampert also makes great use of the Spikes\nSkarmory can lay. Celebi, Venusaur, and Flygon deserve mentions as well,\nas any one of the three can pair with Swampert for a surefire answer to\nany Electric-type, regardless of the Hidden Power of choice.\nFurthermore, Celebi can provide valuable cleric support for Swampert.</p>\n<p>Swampert also appreciates Rapid Spin support; however, none of the OU\nspinners--namely Claydol, Starmie, Donphan, Forretress, and\nCloyster--form good synergy with the mudfish. Of the above, Starmie is\nprobably the best option. Depending on its coverage move alongside Surf,\nRapid Spin, and Recover, Starmie covers different counters to Swampert.\nIf it runs Ice Beam, it beats Celebi without a Grass-type move, while\nThunderbolt lets it beat Suicune and Gyarados. Swampert likes the\nsupport of other bulky Water-types as well, because those Water-types\ncan act as emergency counters to certain Pokemon--such as Flygon,\nTyranitar, and Metagross--should Swampert go down to a powerful Choice\nBand-boosted Focus Punch from Tyranitar or a sneaky Hidden Power Grass.\nEspecially if it carries Roar, this Swampert set appreciates Wish\nsupport from the likes of Vaporeon and Blissey, as it does not have a\nreliable way of healing itself.</p>\n"

Skarmory is the best provider of Spikes support, which lets\nSwampert wear down its opponents. Tyranitar provides the sand that this\nset is best used in; it can also take on Celebi and Zapdos to a certain\nextent, both of which threaten Swampert. Swampert's ability to wear the\nopposing team down might also facilitate a late-game Dragon Dance\nTyranitar sweep.</p>\n"

          "description": "<p>Keep using Substitute on attacks until Salac Berry is activated, and\nthen spam Endeavor. If your opponent was faster than Swampert, then this\nwill lead to an ideal situation of gaining a Salac boost while being\nbehind a Substitute. In the sand, Endeavor coupled with residual damage\nwould guarantee a kill against the many Pokemon not immune to neither\nsand or Endeavor. If Swampert is behind a Sub, it can even Endeavor a\nsecond target. The beauty of this set, that Swampert's Torrent-boosted\nHydro Pump and Ice Beam inflicts significant damage thanks to pumping\nEVs into Swampert's Special Attack; this means that Swampert can save\nEndeavor for later use. The Timid nature allows you to outspeed max\nSpeed Gengar after the boost from Salac Berry, and then nail it with a\nTorrent-boosted Hydro Pump. While the set may seem basic, it can be\ndeadly for unprepared players. Despite how dangerous it can be, this set\ndoes have many noticeable flaws which you should be aware of if you're\ninclined to use it, or if you're looking for ways to stop it.</p>\n<p>Starmie, Celebi, and Blissey are hard counters to this variant of\nSwampert. Starmie can switch in right away on Swampert and continuously\nuse Rapid Spin to waste all of its PP. Swampert can't even Hydro Pump or\nIce Beam to force an attack, as Starmie will easily Recover it off.\nStarmie's 361 Speed is enough to outspeed Swampert after a Salac Berry\nboost, meaning that Starmie can revenge kill it afterwards as well.\nCelebi and Blissey counter a bit differently. While they can both stall\nSwampert out of general PP as well, and if Swampert does manage to get\ninto Endeavor range, Celebi and Blissey can begin using Recover and\nSoft-Boiled, respectively, to waste Endeavor's PP. Swampert will\neventually be forced to switch attacks to Ice Beam before Endeavor runs\nout of PP in the hopes of receiving a freeze. However, an attempted Ice\nBeam while Celebi or Blissey attacks will result in a dead Swampert.</p>\n<p>Because Swampert only reaches 360 Speed after the boost, it will likely\nonly be able to take down one Pokemon before being revenge killed. The\nissue is that Swampert will be sacrificing itself for a Pokemon that the\nopponent gets to choose, which may not be a trade you want to make.\nSwampert also needs Sandstorm up for this set to be truly effective, as\notherwise Endeavor will fail to actually kill things. This isn't a flaw\nas much as it is restricting yourself, but it is important to know.\nDespite all of these shortcomings, this set has gained some notoriety\nand there are ways to maximize its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>If you are using Endeavor Swampert, there is a handful of mandatory or\nbeneficial support to take full advantage of this set. As mentioned\nabove, Tyranitar is an obligatory partner to make Endeavor an automatic\nKO for Pokemon that are not immune to sand or Endeavor. Secondly, Rapid\nSpin support is quite critical in order to have control over Swampert's\nHP. Even more, by clearing away Spikes from the field, Swampert can\nswitch out even at 1% to strike again at a more opportune time. This\nway, Celebi, Starmie, or Blissey cannot switch into the fully loaded\nSwampert the next time it emerges. It may seem a waste to lose the Speed\nboost from Salac Berry, but at 240 Speed, Swampert is still fast enough\nto terrorize many defensive Pokemon.</p>\n<p>Combined with Rapid Spin support, Swampert also appreciates\nsleep-inducing moves for free switch-in opportunities. This is\nparticularly true when Swampert is forced out with 1% left. Hypnosis\nMilotic deserves a special mention for not only providing this\nbeneficial sleep-inducing capability, but also for assuming Swampert's\nconventional role as a bulky Water-type to check dangerous threats.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Swampert is one of the most important Pokemon in the ADV metagame and\nmakes a great defensive pivot. Whenever you have a Swampert in your\nteam, it's usually in the thick of the action. It shapes the metagame to\nthe extent that everyone and their dog eschews Hidden Power Ice for\nHidden Power Grass on Electric-type Pokemon, such as Raikou, solely to\nnail Swampert.</p>\n<p>Swampert's ability to counter common physical powerhouses (such as\nFlygon, Metagross, Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Salamence, and\nAerodactyl), combined with its all-important Rock resistance and very\ngood bulk, are excellent attributes to have. It is a reliable phazer as\nwell, and it can even clean up opposing teams late-game with Curse.\nSwampert is one of the few bulky Water-types that is immune to sandstorm\ndamage, and is therefore relatively hard to wear down.</p>\n<p>However, Swampert does suffer from a crippling quadruple weakness to\nGrass, which hinders its ability to check Electric-types that run Hidden\nPower Grass. This weakness is also exploited by Metagross and Tyranitar\nto lure in their biggest counter for a crippling blow. Furthermore,\nSwampert is vulnerable to Spikes damage, which is particularly\nundesirable as it often must switch in multiple times in a game. It also\nfears status, especially poison, as residual damage reduces its ability\nto tank hits. Finally, though Swampert is excellent at forcing switches,\nit often has trouble doing much damage to switch-ins. Overall, Swampert\nis a key threat in ADV OU.</p>\n",

      }, 
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>Thanks to its good base 110 Attack, Swampert can utilize a Choice Band\nto surprise a few of its usual switch-ins. Celebi, for example, is\nOHKOed by Hidden Power Bug, and Ludicolo doesn't enjoy taking one\neither. However, this set is a worse check to the likes of Salamence and\nTyranitar, who will wear it down more quickly than defensive sets, and\nSwampert really needs Leftovers recovery in order to stick around. The\nmain niche of a Choice Band set is the element of surprise, so make sure\nthat you get it in without taking any damage. Swampert can also pull off\na CounterCoat set alongside one of its STAB moves and Roar to punish\nopponents that set up on it. However, it will only work with Spikes\nsupport, as a good opponent will otherwise continually switch out of\nSwampert to burn its PP. Curse with three attacks can be used, but it\nthrows Swampert into a sweeping role rather than a supportive role since\nit loses out on phazing, Protect, and Rest. Swampert can go with a\nSubPunch set, but Substitute taxes its HP too much for this to be\nworthwhile, and Swampert has better things to do in general. Swampert's\nmovepool isn't particularly big, so it's best to stick to the listed\nsets.</p>\n<p>Special Defense EVs can be used to help Swampert take random attacks\nbetter late in a game from Jirachi and Gengar. Still, don't expect your\nSwampert to stand up to many Grass-type attacks thrown your way.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Celebi is an excellent answer to Swampert, as it can set up Calm Mind\nboosts with impunity while dealing residual damage with Leech Seed; it\ncan also just bash away at Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Ice Beam\ndoes at most around 40% to Celebi--although this depends on the EV\nspreads both Pokemon run--so Celebi has little to fear from Swampert.\nSpecially defensive Zapdos with Hidden Power Grass is good counter to\nSwampert, as it takes little from Ice Beam and is immune to both Spikes\nand Earthquake. Its fellow legendary bird Articuno also does a pretty\ngood job at countering Swampert thanks to its immunity to Earthquake,\nSpikes, and Ice Beam's freeze chance, along with its high Special\nDefense. Toxic will quickly wear down any Swampert without Rest.</p>\n<p>Heracross does a pretty good job against Swampert as it resists\nEarthquake and has the Special Defense to take Hydro Pump and Ice Beam\nwith relative ease. Heracross can then proceed to take chunks of HP out\nof Swampert with Megahorn. Venusaur does a number on Swampert with its\nstrong Grass-type STAB. Giga Drain Gengar is a decent answer to\nSwampert, as it is immune to Earthquake and only fears being hit by\nHydro Pump or Surf on the switch. To avoid activating Torrent, Timid\nGengar should use Giga Drain when Swampert's health is at around 75% for\na clean KO. Skarmory can deal with any Swampert that lack Hydro Pump or\nSurf by freely setting up Spikes on it. Specially defensive Skarmory\nwith Rest can even stall out Swampert with Hydro Pump most of the time.\nBlissey possesses enough physical bulk to tank Swampert's Earthquake\ncomfortably while being able to wear it down with Seismic Toss or Calm\nMind-boosted Ice Beams or Hidden Power Grass. Similarly to Blissey,\nPorygon2 can sponge hits from Swampert while also having access to\nRecover for negating whatever injury Swampert might have caused. Another\nbulky Normal-type, Snorlax, can comfortably set up Curse against\nSwampert lacking Roar. Physically defensive Regice with enough Speed EVs\ncan survive three Earthquakes and restore health with Rest before\nSwampert can finish it off.</p>\n<p>Gyarados is an excellent answer to Swampert that lack Rock Slide, and\ncan set up multiple Dragon Dance boosts while using Taunt to stop\nSwampert from phazing it out. Suicune is also a strong Swampert counter,\nas it takes little from anything Swampert can throw at it and can either\ninflict decent damage with Surf, set up with Calm Mind, or even phaze it\nto rack up Spikes damage. Milotic can use Recover to heal off any\ndamage, and can whittle away at Swampert's HP with Surf and Toxic.\nHowever, Milotic itself must be cautious of Swampert's Toxic. Vaporeon\ncan Wish in Swampert's face and only fears Toxic. Ludicolo is a solid\ncounter to Swampert as it takes pitiful damage from any of Swampert's\nattacks--once again, it only fears Toxic--and can either OHKO Swampert\nwith Hidden Power Grass or wear it down with Leech Seed, should it lack\na Grass-type attack.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Thanks to a great base 90 Attack stat, a typing that allows some free switches, and decent coverage, a Choice Band set is very viable. Lairon's Steel typing gives it a bit of a niche over the other Rock-types in the tier, making it a bit less susceptible to the special attackers they are normally forced to switch out of like Chimecho, Roselia, and Haunter. Lairon also still completely walls the physical attackers it needs to. Hidden Power Rock and Iron Tail are the recommended STAB moves due to the former's reliability and the latter's sheer power. However, if you're uncomfortable using Iron Tail due to its accuracy, Rock Slide can be used over Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Steel can be used over Iron Tail. Earthquake and Double-Edge complete the set's coverage, with Double-Edge chosen in the last slot over Return thanks to the lack of recoil due to Rock Head.</p>\n<p>Some Speed EVs can be run to let Lairon outpace minimum Speed base 50s; however, Lairon needs all the bulk it can get in order to tank special attacks like Chimecho's Psychic. A switch-in to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is needed for this set to be effective, making Pelipper, defensive Tangela, and Whiscash valued teammates. Lairon is extremely weak to most special attackers with this set even with its many resistances. Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung are good specially defensive teammates that can take on a large portion of the special attackers in the tier, though they stack a major weakness to Hitmonchan with Lairon. Swalot is another option to switch into special attackers, and it can also take on the likes of Hitmonchan very well, though it too stacks a weakness to Ground-type attacks. An offensively inclined teammate like your own Hitmonchan is recommended, as Lairon effectively walls a number of Pokemon that normally force Hitmonchan out, particularly Pidgeot, Murkrow, and Raticate.</p>\n"

A great Defense stat backed by a decent typing allows Lairon to almost completely wall a few Choice Band users, particularly Normal- and Flying-types like Raticate, Pidgeot, and Murkrow. However, Lairon comes with awful, terrible, horrible 4x weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which are found on virtually all Choice Band users' sets, diminishing its overall effectiveness as a physical wall, which is compounded by its rather low Special Defense stat. Ultimately, Lairon is a subpar choice in the metagame but a neat Pokemon to use regardless if you want a super solid switch-in to Normal-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Rock-type attacks.</p>\n",

Body Slam is a neat alternative that can help spread paralysis to allow a slow teammate like Octillery to sweep late-game. Endeavor is available but is hard to use and doesn't accomplish much for Lairon in the long run. Finally, Rock Tomb is an OK move when used with some Speed investment to allow Lairon or another teammate to get the jump on the foe. However, Lairon has trouble making use of it itself due to its low Speed and lack of very strong STAB attacks.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Hitmonchan is the best check and counter to Lairon, as it really only fears a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge and can threaten Lairon with a quick OHKO with either Sky Uppercut or Earthquake in return. From there, really any Fighting- or Ground-type attack will remove Lairon from of the game, even weak, non-STAB Hidden Powers. Water-types, particularly Relicanth, Huntail, and Whiscash, have an easy time of switching in and disposing of Lairon. Tangela can easily switch in, tank anything Lairon can throw at it, and remove it with its strong STAB Grass-type moves. Mawile almost completely walls all that Lairon can throw at it, even being immune to Toxic, and can threaten it in return with Focus Punch. Piloswine doesn't get in as safely as other checks but easily annihilates Lairon with Earthquake. Finally, while Diglett can't switch in easily, it can trap and cleanly OHKO Lairon with its own Earthquake.</p>\n",

It's faster than Metagross, too, since Metagross usually just pumps HP and Defense in place of Speed. Since Deoxys-D never has more than 24 or so Speed EVs for Tyranitar (and even that's considered fast), Speed EVs are really just to beat out enemy Ho-Oh, Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Rayquaza has a higher base Speed, and will sometimes go Jolly to give those Latias and Latios that only run 307 Speed a scare with Choice Band Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Ghost, and you can only tie with Kyogre and Groudon. For this reason, Speed EVs aren't essential. Instead, you could run a 252 HP, 252 Attack, 4 Special Defense spread, as outlined in the Choice Band set, to be able to take more hits from the Pokemon that are faster than you anyway, and just try burning physical attackers on the switch.

Milotic\ncan temporarily put Suicune out of commission with Toxic or Hypnosis,\nwhich allows another sweeper to set up on it or just go for the KO.\nGyarados is a solid answer thanks to its decent natural Special Defense.\nIt also has Taunt at its disposal to prevent Suicune from using Roar; it\ncan set up Dragon Dance boosts at will and sweep.</p>\n<p>Suicune is highly vulnerable when asleep if it lacks Sleep Talk;\nhard-hitters, such as Choice Band Salamence, can KO it before it wakes\nup. Most powerful Choice Band users work similarly\u2014with the exception of\nMetagross, as Suicune resists Meteor Mash\u2014but Metagross's Earthquake\nisn't much weaker than Salamence's Hidden Power Flying. Heracross can\ntake it on any time whether it's awake or asleep, but a sleeping Suicune\nis much easier to switch in on. Choice Band Megahorn 2HKOes Suicune, and\nHeracross also has decent Special Defense to take a few Surfs. Heracross\nshould be cautious of more offensive versions of Suicune.</p>\n<p>Zapdos can take Suicune on with STAB Thunderbolt, but it doesn't like\nswitching into Ice Beam. Raikou fares a bit better, as it has better\nSpecial Defense and isn't weak to Ice or Water; it can also set up Calm\nMind against a sleeping Suicune or one that lacks Roar, and sweep its\nwhole team. Even Roar variants will often be too afraid to stay in and\nphaze for fear of taking ~70% from Thunderbolt, and even if they do,\nRaikou can just come right back in and try it again. If you wait too\nlong, however, Suicune can get some Calm Mind boosts in, and with as\nlittle as one Calm Mind, that 2HKO can become a 3HKO, and Suicune's 3HKO\non the counter can be a 2HKO. This is why physical threats such as\nHeracross are such good counters compared to Electric-types: even if\nSuicune gets several Calm Mind boosts, Heracross can take it out with\nimpunity. Of course, immediate response to Suicune in the form of a\nhard-hitter will also stop this. While Tyranitar itself loses handily to\nSuicune, its Sand Stream ability puts a damper on Suicune's tanking\nability, as the latter lacks a recovery move outside of Rest.</p>\n",

While Huntail is more powerful and faster in rain, Seadra does not need to rely on rain being active in order to outspeed a huge portion of the metagame and blast foes with its STAB move, making it a bit more reliable in that regard. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is the age-old story of power vs accuracy. Hydro Pump is generally preferred due to the chance to break through defensive stalwarts like Swalot and Lickitung; however, the tier is pretty specially frail on the whole, making Surf a decent option.</p>\n<p>Ice Beam and either Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Electric give Seadra almost perfect neutral coverage on the tier, which Seadra is thankful for because it really does not have a movepool outside of that, making the last slot somewhat of a filler option. Substitute is nice to protect Seadra from being revenge killed by the likes of Plusle and Haunter, and it can be used with a Petaya or Salac Berry to give Seadra an extra boost to possibly sweep the opposing team. Toxic is a great way to cripple the special walls that can tank its attacks well, particularly Kecleon and Bellossom. Finally, Agility can turn the tables on the opponent late-game and let Seadra outrun even Huntail in the rain.</p>\n<p>A Timid nature is needed to let Seadra outspeed Glalie and the rare Fire-types that sit near its Speed tier, like Charmeleon and Magby. Modest is still a choice though if you're looking for straight power and is recommended if you're using Hydro Pump. Speaking of power, Mystic Water can be used to give Seadra's Water-type STAB move a bit more bite and ensures a 2HKO on physically defensive Swalot with Hydro Pump and 2HKO on Choice Band Hitmonchan with Surf. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Electric to nail Whiscash, but Electric is generally better, as it provides better neutral coverage and has a more desirable super effective hit on Pelipper.</p>\n<p>Spikes is central to hyper offense teams, making Roselia, Glalie, and Cacturne required teammates, with Roselia in particular sporting great type synergy with Seadra. Bellossom is a huge threat to this set, as it is tanky enough to withstand Ice Beam and easily OHKOes Seadra with any of its STAB moves. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon are thus good offensive teammates to pair with Seadra, as they can take advantage of Bellossom and OHKO it, and in Flareon's case, enjoy a nice Sunny Day boost as well should Bellossom choose to set up. Plusle and Haunter are the main revenge killers to watch out for when using this set, making a special tank a recommended teammate; Chimecho is a good team choice, as it can continue to pressure the opponent with offensive Calm Mind sets. Finally, Hitmonchan is a great offensive partner to blow through a few of the special walls that stand in Seadra's way, while Seadra soaks the physical walls that give Hitmonchan some trouble.</p>\n"

      "overview": "<p>Seadra sports great Speed and Special Attack stats for a Water-type in NU, and it doesn't need rain support to be an immediate threat. It's very one-dimensional, but a decent choice for high offense teams. Most other Water-types in the tier are too weak, too slow, or need setup to be useful, and Seadra is just good right off the bat. However, it's relatively easy to wall and has no way of breaking its usual counters, as it doesn't have a way of boosting its attacks outside of Rain Dance, which doesn't give it a Speed boost, unlike its main competition in Huntail. All in all, Seadra is a great choice, just make sure Huntail isn't a better choice for your team.</p>\n",

Rain Dance is an option to boost its STAB attacks and form a dual-sweeping core with Huntail. Blizzard offers more power than Ice Beam and can make Bellossom a more risky switch-in to Seadra, but the accuracy just kills it as a reliable option. Finally, Hidden Power Dark gives Seadra a super effective hit on Chimecho.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Specially defensive Bellossom is probably the best answer to Seadra available, as it can withstand an Ice Beam or two and proceed to OHKO Seadra back with any of its STAB moves. Dewgong is the next best answer, as it is avoids the 3HKO from Hidden Power and can proceed to 2HKO back if it's carrying its own Hidden Power or 3HKO with Surf or Ice Beam. Specially defensive Lickitung, Swalot, and Kecleon are the next best answers, as they are not threatened by a 2HKO from any of Seadra's moves and can proceed to stall it out. Finally, Seadra is relatively easily revenge killed by most Pokemon with neutral or super effective special attacks. Plusle and Haunter both outspeed Seadra and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Roselia can tank an Ice Beam and OHKO with Giga Drain. Maximum Special Attack Chimecho can easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric and tank a Hydro Pump.</p>\n",

Gengar and Dusclops resist Victreebel's STAB\nas well. They can both Will-O-Wisp, but Gengar can also use Ice Punch\nfor a load of damage.</p>\n<p>In Underused matches, Muk resists Sludge Bomb and Grass moves and can\nSludge Bomb or use a Fire move on Victreebel's low defenses. Altaria\nresists Grass moves, but should watch out for these dangerous Sludge\nBombs. He doesn't mind Victreebel's status employment though. Camerupt\nresists Sludge Bomb and OHKOes with his Fire moves, but a Solar Beam\nnearly OHKOes it. Gligar walls physical sets nicely with his good\nDefense and natural Sludge Bomb resistance, but Grass moves will hurt\nhim. His Hidden Power Flying really hurts Victreebel though. Any Fire\ntype is going to OHKO Victreebel, they should all beware of that nasty\nSTAB Sludge Bomb, but if Victreebel uses Sunny Day they can really take\nadvantage of that. Beware of Misdreavus as well, who can Thunder Wave or\nHidden Power Ice Victreebel.</p>\n<p>All of Victreebel's counters risk being Sleep Powdered, so try to absorb\nthat with a Sleep Talker first, or put Sleep Talk on a counter.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>STAB Pursuit, a diverse movepool, and the stats to back it up make\nTyranitar a premier wallbreaker in ADV OU. This set utilizes Tyranitar's\nspecial moves to assist in taking down more defensive teams while\nsimultaneously threatening unprepared offensive teams. One of the major\nselling points of this set is its ability to effectively trap and kill\nGengar with Pursuit. Gengar's only way to damage Tyranitar usually lies\nin Giga Drain and Will-O-Wisp, both of which this Tyranitar can brush\noff. With Gengar down, spinning becomes much easier, which is why this\nset is more effective when paired with a Rapid Spin user.</p>\n<p>Fire Blast wears down Skarmory, Forretress, and other Steel-types. With\nthe threat and rising usage of special Tyranitar, these Pokemon might be\nwary about staying in. While this might limit the amount of kills you\nget with Tyranitar, keeping Spikes users at bay is never a bad idea and\nallows Tyranitar to spam Rock Slide more freely. Fire Blast may also be\nyour strongest move in general at times. If the accuracy is a concern,\nFlamethrower can be used over Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass allows\nTyranitar to take down one of ADV's most heralded Pokemon, Swampert. It\npairs well with Fire Blast, providing a sense of offense versus opposing\nTyranitar and other bulky Water-types. On more offensive teams, Hidden\nPower Grass is a great way to lure in opposing Swampert and take them\ndown. Rock Slide is generally more common in the last slot because of\nTyranitar's phenomenal Attack and for the ability to hit threats such as\nBlissey, Zapdos, and Salamence. However, Ice Beam allows Tyranitar to\nkeep its Special Defense intact by switching to a Modest nature while\ngiving it more Special Attack to play with. Ice Beam allows Tyranitar to\ntake on Flygon, Zapdos, and Salamence while also providing a guaranteed\nOHKO on Dugtrio.</p>\n<p>188 HP EVs allow Tyranitar to survive Dugtrio's Earthquake and give\nTyranitar the bulk to successfully threaten defensive Pokemon that have\ndecent Attack. The Speed EVs outspeed 4 Speed Skarmory, allowing\nTyranitar to Fire Blast before they have a chance to use Spikes. The\nrest is placed into Special Attack to make sure Tyranitar finishes the\njob.</p>\n"

Earthquake + Rock Slide is great STAB coverage and all that Pupitar really needs most of the time. At +1, Rock Slide is a guaranteed OHKO vs 252 HP Glalie and offensive Pelipper, whereas Hidden Power Rock just falls short and doesn't come with a flinch chance, making Rock Slide the more desired option for Rock STAB despite the lower accuracy.</p>\n<p>Hidden Power Bug can be used in the last slot for a reliable 2HKO on all but the most physically defensive Chimecho and Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela, though standard defensive Tangela can avoid the 2HKO and OHKO Pupitar in return with its STAB moves. Protect is a neat alternative that can bide time for Leftovers recovery, pushing Pupitar out of a 3HKO range from Seismic Toss and Night Shade. Protect also comes with the benefit of scouting the opponent's Choice Band moves and allows for extra turns to activate Shed Skin if needed.</p>\n<p>A Jolly nature is needed for Pupitar to outpace the entire unboosted tier after a single Dragon Dance, as well as ensure that Pupitar can outspeed maximum investment base 50s before boosting, primarily Timid Bellossom. An Adamant nature can be used, but this leaves Pupitar at only 302 Speed at +1, leaving it outsped by all maximum investment base 90s and up, including big threats like Venomoth, Haunter, and Plusle. Taunt is a great choice for the last slot as it prevents the opponent from setting up on it or healing and can bide time for extra turns of Leftovers recovery and Shed Skin activation. Hidden Power Flying is the best alternative to Hidden Power Bug as it gets a super effective hit on Hitmonchan and retains the super effective hit on Bellossom and Tangela. Rest can be used in the last slot to let Pupitar quickly recover health and remove status manually, and it has a high chance of wearing off early thanks to Shed Skin. This is difficult to pull off though, especially considering that even extremely defensive teams will have multiple moves that will easily 2HKO Pupitar. Finally, Double-Edge can fill out the set and is a great safety move to use when you're unsure of what the opponent will switch to next, although it does come with some recoil.</p>\n<p>Spikes are a great tool to generally weaken the checks and counters to Pupitar, as all of them are grounded, particularly the Grass- and Water-types. Flareon and Murkrow are good partners to take out the Grass-types that threaten Pupitar easily, while Plusle and Grass-types of your own can take out the Water-types that stand in Pupitar's path. Hidden Power Grass Plusle for example can eliminate Whiscash and nearly all of the other Water-types in the tier. Physically defensive Chimecho tank Pupitar's STAB moves and threatens an easy 2HKO back with Psychic if Pupitar lacks Hidden Power Bug, making Sableye and Metang good partners too.</p>\n<p>Pupitar can have a tough time setting up if it can't get in against a Normal-, Bug-, Rock-, or Flying-type locked into an ineffective move, making an Encore partner or a screen partner a good teammate as well to give Pupitar the best chance of setting up as possible. A particularly good screen partner is Reflect Piloswine, as it tends to lure in Hitmonchan and can eliminate its threat of Mach Punch before bringing in Pupitar to clean the rest of the opponent's team.</p>\n"

At just +1, Pupitar packs only slightly less power than Choice Band Relicanth while also outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Its access to fantastic offensive STAB moves cannot be understated, and Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Flying both give Pupitar the coverage it needs. Even its ability Shed Skin is a gigantic perk that protects it somewhat against sleep, burn, and paralysis, and with a natural immunity to Thunder Wave, Pupitar has an easy time steamrolling over purely defensive teams. The only major downside is that Pupitar is rather slow before boosting, which can leave it vulnerable to more offensive teams. Outside of Dragon Dance, though, Pupitar is heavily outclassed by the other Rock-types in the tier, which are far stronger and bulkier, including Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Relicanth.</p>\n",

Taunt + Dragon Dance and Substitute + Dragon Dance both have their perks and can secure a sweep where just having the coverage of Hidden Power Bug would not, but finding the time to use both moves can be a daunting task when a good portion of the tier has a move that will hit Pupitar super effectively. Adding Liechi Berry to the Substitute + Dragon Dance set is an option that has a huge payoff if done well. A bulky EV spread and the Dragon Dance set above can be done, but Pupitar doesn't have much bulk to speak of, and the only real benefit would be making Pupitar harder to KO with Hitmonchan's Mach Punch.</p>\n<p>A Choice Band set is certainly doable, and Pupitar has a huge perk in outspeeding max Speed Mawile and other base 50s like Piloswine. However, while there may be a bit of a surprise factor to running Choice Band, Pupitar will still be weaker than the likes of Sudowoodo and Graveler and would much rather keep its main advantage of outspeeding the tier after a boost rather than having immediately strong moves. Finally, Toxic is an option to get cripple defensive Tangela, but that's about the only target it'll make an impact on.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Physically defensive Tangela is probably the ultimate switch-in to Pupitar, as it's not 2HKOed by anything a +1 Pupitar can throw at it and easily OHKOes in return with Hidden Power Grass. Even at +5 Pupitar will fail to OHKO defensive Tangela with Hidden Power Bug. Physically defensive Whiscash, Wailord, and Kingler are probably the next best defensive switch-ins to Pupitar, as they can tank an Earthquake with ease and OHKO Pupitar in return with Surf. Physically defensive Relicanth can tank an Earthquake or two if using Protect and easily 2HKO Pupitar with its own Earthquake.</p>\n<p>Bulky Hitmonchan, Hitmonchan with Mach Punch, and Machoke can prevent Pupitar from getting too dangerous and pick off weakened ones easily enough. Defensive Bellossom takes a lot from Hidden Power Bug but also easily OHKOes with Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain. Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail will be able to tank an attack and OHKO in return, but they will leave the exchange heavily battered. It should be noted that Huntail can even use a +1 Pupitar as setup bait if Huntail is at full health, as it can tank an Earthquake, set up Rain Dance, and then outspeed and OHKO the next turn; Timid Huntail is fast enough to not fear Pupitar getting to +2 either. Finally, Piloswine can tank multiple attacks from Pupitar from behind a Reflect and easily OHKO in return with Earthquake.</p>\n",

Otherwise, concentrate on Special Attack. If you really feel like it, with max HP and around 280 Defense, Kyogre can take a Swords Danced Groudon Earthquake. There are two main ways to do the Speed. If Kyogre is your lead, you'll most likely want to make it as slow as possible, perhaps even giving it a -Speed nature and 0 IVs. This is so that when you are up against starter Groudon, your weather can go after theirs, thus claiming priority, forcing a switch. Non-boosted Groudon will not OHKO Kyogre, while Kyogre OHKOes Groudon in the rain with any Water move. As Kyogre is already tied for slowest Uber (and all Pokemon used in Ubers slower than Kyogre are slower, regardless of EVs, for example, Blissey), Speed won't really change much. However, since a lot of people think this way, it's very easy to beat out enemy Kyogre, Groudon, a lot of Lugia, Adamant Rayquaza, and even some Latias and Latios.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Blissey with max Special Defense (unless it has Substitute or Rest), or\nCalm Mind / Psych Up + Thunder, Hidden Power Grass Ludicolo, Quagsire\n(especially for sets with only Thunder and Surf), Shedinja (beware of\nSpikes), Latias, Celebi (if it doesn't have Ice Beam), Lanturn with\nToxic or Mimic.</p>\n<h1>Controlling the Weather</h1>\n<p><em>Leads</em></p>\n<p>In a match-up of Kyogre vs. Groudon, if both Pokemon are the first each battler sends out, the slower Pokemon will always control the weather. This is because the faster Pokemon's weather activates first, but is promptly overwritten by the slower Pokemon's.</p>\n<p><em>Switches</em></p>\n<p>If Kyogre switches into Groudon, or vice versa, the weather will change.</p>\n<p>If Kyogre and Groudon switch into each other at the same time, then the person who makes the decision last switches in their Pokemon last, thus dominating the skies. In matches where a person has a limited amount of time to move, this can cause the players to try and play chicken, waiting until the clock is as close to running out as they dare before punching in the move, and praying the connection doesn't lag.</p>\n<p><em>Rayquaza / Golduck</em></p>\n<p>If Rayquaza or Cloud Nine Golduck is out, it will report that the weather is still going strong. However, there will be no effect. Solar Beam takes 2 turns, Thunder has 70% accuracy, and no moves are boosted / weakened. If Kyogre or Groudon switch into Rayquaza, Air Lock will still be in play.

Ice Beam is chosen as the main STAB move, as it prevents Grass-types from switching in easily and gives Dewgong a tool to check Sunny Day Tangela and Bellossom, and STAB Ice Beam is kind of hard to switch into in general. Surf is a good choice for the second slot as a secondary STAB move that has fantastic coverage with Ice Beam, allowing Dewgong to effectively threaten Fire- and Steel-types. Alternatively, Toxic or Perish Song can be chosen instead, the former giving Dewgong a tool to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise be able to wall it endlessly like Kecleon and Lickitung, and the latter making Dewgong one of the best checks to Calm Mind Chimecho in the tier. The last two slots are dedicated to RestTalk, which is the best method for keeping Dewgong around for the whole match and lets it absorb status like Toxic as well.</p>\n<p>Toxic and Protect can be run together in the last two slots over RestTalk to increase Dewgong's flexibility and allow it to scout for the opponent's movesets. However, the longevity provided by RestTalk is usually far more preferable. Encore can be used in the second moveslot to disrupt an opponent's defensive Pokemon or lock an offensive Pokemon into an ineffective move. More Speed can be run, but Dewgong is already the fastest defensive Pokemon in the tier. Generally, just dropping a couple more EVs in Speed will ensure that the offensive Pokemon using minimum Speed Dewgong as their target won't be able to outspeed it.</p>\n<p>Most Rock- and Ground-types can't switch into Dewgong safely, but Dewgong still needs a teammate that can switch into Rock-type attacks. Piloswine, Whiscash, and Mawile are all good options to take on the few Rock-type attacks that Dewgong can't ward off on its own. Hitmonchan is a major threat to Dewgong, especially considering it has a high base Special Defense stat, meaning Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types are good teammates to help combat it. Physically defensive Chimecho also has an easy enough time with most of the Rock-types that threaten Dewgong.</p>\n<p>Plusle and strong Grass-type attackers like Sunny Day Bellossom can still run straight through Dewgong despite its massive Special Defense, making a Pokemon like Roselia or Kecleon still a good teammate to have around, but be careful of stacking too many Pokemon on your team susceptible to Hitmonchan and other physical threats like Vigoroth. For this reason, Swalot makes a very effective physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Dewgong, as it can also take on the few special attackers that give Dewgong trouble.</p>\n"

Surf pairs exceptionally well with Ice Beam and takes out the Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types that may be able to stomach an Ice Beam. Hidden Power Electric completes the coverage against opposing Water-types, though Hidden Power Grass may be chosen for a better hit on Whiscash and Relicanth.</p>\n<p>The last slot on this set is almost completely filler, and it depends entirely on what you'd like Dewgong to do for the team when blasting the foe isn't the best option. Encore prevents the opponent from setting up against Dewgong and can lock a defensive Pokemon into a non-damaging move. Toxic can wear down the defensive Pokemon that can comfortably wall Dewgong's attacks, particularly Kecleon and Lickitung. Perish Song ensures that Dewgong can't get run over by a late-game sweeper like Calm Mind Chimecho, and it forces switches against other bulky setup Pokemon like Wailord.</p>\n<p>Dewgong naturally outpaces every other major defensive Pokemon in the tier, meaning it can devote EVs that would normally be spent on Speed to HP to increase its overall bulk. However, running Speed is still an option, and max Speed ensures that Dewgong can outspeed certain attackers, most notably Flareon, as well as unboosted Pupitar, Tangela, and Huntail. However, even with max Speed Dewgong fails to outrun its most dangerous threats, namely Hitmonchan, Plusle, and Haunter, so in the end investing in bulk will probably be the most helpful.</p>\n<p>Icy Wind can be used on this set pretty effectively to allow another slower teammate to come in against a switch-in to Dewgong and outspeed it. This is particularly effective for counteracting the opponent's Hitmonchan and Plusle. This set is much harder for something like Hitmonchan to switch into, and Spikes makes this set even more effective, meaning Roselia is a fantastic teammate, particularly as it can provide a secondary check to Grass- and Electric-types. An offensive Pokemon that can switch into Hitmonchan is still recommended, particularly Chimecho and Haunter, as they can keep up offensive momentum. Special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung are of particular concern when using this set, making strong physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Piloswine, and Flareon good teammates.

However, Dewgong can effectively check these Pokemon using a specially defensive set, and Dewgong still takes too much damage from most Rock- and Fighting-type attacks when using a physically defensive spread.</p>\n<p>Blizzard is a viable alternative to Ice Beam despite the shoddy accuracy thanks to its incredible damage output when it connects. Body Slam is a decent move to use on the defensive set to spread paralysis, which can make sweeping for slow Pokemon like Octillery much easier. Finally, Safeguard is a great move to protect Dewgong and its team from Toxic and other status, and Dewgong is probably the best user of the move since it outspeeds the other defensive Pokemon of the tier. However, Encore is generally more effective in this regard.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Hitmonchan fears little from Dewgong, outspeeds it, and pulverizes it with STAB Sky Uppercut. Plusle and Haunter have a tougher time switching in, but both do a lot with Thunderbolt, and Plusle can lock Dewgong into a useless move with Encore. Defensively, Kecleon and Lickitung fear almost nothing from Dewgong apart from Toxic. However, if Dewgong is running RestTalk at most they will stall Dewgong down to a stalemate. Calm Mind Chimecho has a very easy time setting up on Dewgong lacking Perish Song.</p>\n<p>Rock-type attacks in general do a ton to Dewgong; however, the only Rock-type that can effectively take on Dewgong one-on-one is Relicanth thanks to its resistance to Ice Beam and neutrality to Surf. Steel-types like Mawile and Metang also resist Ice Beam and are immune to Toxic, though they need to be careful of Surf. Finally, offensive Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela can blow through Dewgong with Sleep Powder and Solar Beam, though they do not like Ice Beam.</p>\n",

While Tyranitar can't take Fighting attacks, it\nresists Sludge Bomb and Fire moves, and often packs Earthquake.</p>\n<p>Suicune can take most of Muk's physical assaults, Roar away Curse\nboosts, Calm Mind up, then Surf Muk into oblivion. Gengar 4x resists\nSludge Bomb and is immune to Explosion and any Fighting or Ground moves\nMuk might be packing, so unless Muk carries Hidden Power Ghost or a move\nsuch as Thunderbolt or Fire Blast, Gengar will beat it one-on-one,\nespecially if Gengar carries Psychic.

Hasty is the best nature for mixed sets, as Tentacruel's massive Special Defense is one of its major selling points, but if you're not using your Attack or Special Attack at all, Timid or Jolly should be used respectively. Stack the attacking stat(s) you're using on sweeping Tentacruel, otherwise you'll want to max out HP and put some in Special Defense.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>Standard: Swampert is the best all-around counter for Tentacruel, as\nlong as Tentacruel isn't packing the rare Giga Drain. It can soak up\nSludge Bombs thanks to its resistance, and use its STAB Earthquake to\ndish out damage. Steels like Skarmory and Metagross get in the way when\nTentacruel wants to sweep with Swords Dance, because Skarmory will Roar\n/ Whirlwind away the boosts while Metagross will Earthquake. A few Surfs\nor Hydro Pumps should do them in though. Gengar is 4x resistant to\nSludge Bomb and can Thunderbolt Tentacruel, but again, beware of Surf or\nHydro Pump. Zapdos, Jolteon and Raikou may take quite some damage from a\nSwords Danced Sludge Bomb, but they're quite fast (Zapdos ties with\nTentacruel, the other two are faster) and pack STAB Thunderbolts. Beware\nof Mirror Coat, however. Salamence and Gyarados can Earthquake\nTentacruel and resist his Water moves, but their Intimidate won't work\non Clear Body versions and Salamence has to watch out for Ice Beam.</p>\n<p>UU: Quagsire is an even better counter than Swampert because of Water\nAbsorb, for the rest he works in the same way. Whiscash plays a\nmini-Swampert as well, but to a lesser extent. Hypno with some Defense\nEVs and Reflect can pose trouble, paralyzing Tentacruel with Thunder\nWave or hitting hard with STAB Psychic. A Swords Danced Sludge Bomb will\nbang him up sooner or later though. Kangaskhan can take a beating and\ntry for a paralysis with Body Slam or hit hard with Earthquake. Walrein\ncan Earthquake, or Encore Substitute or Swords Dance, but again these\nSwords Danced Sludge Bombs hurt. For the rest, Tentacruel is pretty hard\nto beat in UU. Your best bet is hitting it hard when you can, preferably\nwith Earthquake. If your team is full of physical offense, Psychic, and\nThunderbolt, you can just make it impossible for Tentacruel to ever\nswitch in.</p>\n",

Bite is an option for other\nPsychic-types but I wouldn't recommend it, because the more powerful\nHidden Power Dark would be better since the Pokemon that are weak to\nDark attacks, Psychics and Ghosts, are all usually faster than Espeon\n(read: Alakazam, Gengar, Starmie), so you won't be flinching the Pokemon\nthat Bite is super effective against. Charm is there for annoyance,\nalthough it is still a move better suited for a Pokemon that is designed\nto actually take physical blows, like Umbreon. The same goes for Wish,\nreally. Reflect can let Espeon keep up a Substitute against both\nphysical and special attacks, but the only thing you could really drop\nfor that is Psychic, which is just going to make life easier for phazers\nlike Skarmory.</p>\n<h1>EVs</h1>\n<p>EspyJump, surprising as it may seem, is a special tank. It is there to lull special attackers into a false sense of security, and then belie its charming exterior by setting up until your opponent realizes you've got three Calm Minds and a Substitute and there's no way that they can break your Substitutes efficiently. For this reason, I prescribe a Timid nature, putting 200 EVs in HP for 321, 236 in SpD for 285 and 72 in Speed for 301. This used to be 296 Speed because when I devised EspyJump in 2004, Choice Band Salamence and its 299 Speed had yet to be created; rather, Heracross and its max-295 speed was the thing to beat. 321 HP is used over 320, as this allows for an extra Substitute, since it's conceivable that Espeon takes no direct damage, thanks to Calm Mind and Substitute blocking attacks, especially if someone attempts to status Espeon, giving you a free turn. Remember, Espeon is not Alakazam, and it doesn't need to outspeed that much, especially if you have a Substitute up and can Baton Pass your Calm Minds to an appropriate teammate anyway before threats like Tauros and Slaking can get you.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p>The Aerodactyl sacrifice and Dugtrio combo can counter this and like 90%\nof the things in the game, but I'll mention it again. The aforementioned\nMetagross, Tyranitar, and Houndoom are all effective counters to\nEspyJump somewhat, as is Claydol (they will all fall to Hidden Power\nFire/Water though), but that is what Baton Pass is for, being faster\nthan all of those Pokemon save Houndoom, whose attack you should be\nprotected against via Substitute or Calm Mind anyway. Tyranitar messes\nwith EspyJump the most, its Sand Stream negating the Leftovers that are\nintegral to its efficacy. And of course I can't forget the obligatory\nBlissey mention, but again, Baton Pass (to a CursePert for example)\nmakes the strategy behind EspyJump virtually uncounterable. Snorlax also\nforces a Baton Pass, and Skarmory and Suicune will Roar you the hell out\nif you don't attack them soon enough, and they of course aren't OHKOed\nanyway. Again, I feel that nothing can really be a &quot;counter&quot; to EspyJump\nunless it manages to phaze it, which Skarmory and a Roaring Suicune can\ndo, which is why you shouldn't always just sit there and set up. If\nyou're worried about getting Roared out, jack up its Special Attack--I'm\nan extremist and I know that putting absolutely no EVs into a Special\nAttack is so sexy (394 highest) is somewhat of a crime.</p>\n<h1>Jumpman16's Final Thoughts</h1>\n<p>Oh EspyJump, you are my first love. This Pokemon has no business being Underused still, and I feel that it is underused because most players think that it is just a weaker version of Alakazam. Espeon was just about my favorite Pokemon in GS because of its looks, and with what I learned it can do in Advance play my love for it just skyrocketed. It is an awesome Pokemon, and I suggest you all give it a try before thinking it should still stay on the UU shelf.</p>\n",

Hidden Power Ground is for\nMetagross, Hidden Power Fighting is for Tyranitar. As Metagross is more\ncommon in ubers, that is a real option, but in standard, Tyranitar is\nthe most common, and most obvious switch when they know you have\nShedinja. Although Shedinja will die next turn, Hidden Power Fighting\nwill do massive damage, if not deal a KO, so it's a kind of kamikaze\nmove. Toxic is also used mostly for uber matches, so Shedinja can\nactually do something to guys like Groudon and Rayquaza.
